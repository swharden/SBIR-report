N95 and related testing protocols effectively assess filtration efficiency for respirators that remain tightly fitted throughout activity, but since these protocols prescribe sealing the tested product to the apparatus, they ignore issues of leakage and poor fit that occur in commonplace face mask products. It is therefore vital that new test methods and protocols be developed to better assess the particulate filtration efficiency that is true to the exposure of the wearer when fit and breathability are considered.
ITA proposes a novel Fitted Filtration Efficiency (FFE) protocol to assess mask/respirator efficacy on a true exposure basis. Headforms exhibiting a range of facial dimensions representative of published population data will be developed and connected to particle counting equipment to measure the as-worn filtration efficiency of face mask/respirator products against standard challenge aerosols. Acquired data will enable consumers and manufacturers to understand the expected fit and filtration efficiency for products in accordance with face size and shape while also providing an assessment of expected protection factor where quantitative fit testing is not routinely available."

These symptoms can also be associated with other serious medical conditions. The proposed technology will aid clinicians in quickly being able to assess their patients’ symptoms and determine if reflux is the underlying cause. A noninvasive diagnostic modality for assessing reflux could save the healthcare system $10 billion annually, allow clinicians to provide improved care to their patients, and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of the 80 million Americans who are affected by reflux-related symptoms._x000D__x000D_
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the development of a patented technology which uses pulse-echo ultrasound and proprietary algorithms in a non-conventional way to create an acoustic signature. The acoustic signature can detect and differentiate a bolus in the esophagus. The esophagus distends in response to a bolus of material, eliciting the esophageal layers to change in respect to one another. These changes can be observed with ultrasound sensors placed externally on the skin. This project will develop and validate electronic hardware, software, and custom ultrasonic transducers._x000D_

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a minimally invasive cryoablation system capable of safely and effectively targeting the gallbladder. Initial testing of the cryoablation system has demonstrated the ability to uniformly generate lethal cryoablation temperatures (less than-20℃) across the gallbladder lumen, leading to durable gallbladder scarring and defunctionalization in porcine animals up to 60 days post-procedure. Key technical objectives of this project are to develop the industrial design of the introducer, cryoablation catheter, and control system for improved clinical usability and manufacturability, to further test and characterize clinical delivery parameters to inform treatment planning, to improve sensor reliability and control system response time to optimize safety profile, and to validate the integrated system in vivo to demonstrate system performance with optimized dosing parameters. The system will be evaluated in an advanced benchtop model gallbladder under a thermal load, ex vivo gallbladder tissues, and an in vivo chronic animal model to optimize and validate the cryoablation catheter and integrated control system.

Modern automation and robotics systems heavily rely on encoders for precision positioning and motion control. The global encoder market is projected to reach $4.4 billion by 2028, growing from $2.4 billion in 2022. Increasingly accurate encoders are needed to further innovate and enable the manufacturing of complex next-generation products, such as advanced microchips, implantable medical devices, and precision weapon systems.

_x000D_
The intellectual merit of this project is focused on developing a technology that has the potential to revolutionize the manufacturing of optical encoders. Traditional encoder production involves using contact photolithography to replicate a pattern from a master photomask. However, this process requires a full-size photomask, introduces defects and errors into the device, and limits the achievable accuracy and resolution. To address these drawbacks, a novel, high-resolution, projection lithography system is being developed to drive an additive micro-fabrication technique. The new approach offers numerous advantages, including economically viable production of precision encoders with sub-nanometer resolution, improved manufacturing yield, and shorter lead times. The Phase II research activities encompass the development of a full-size hardware prototype with performance traceable to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standards, as well as the establishment of the necessary infrastructure to support the newly developed technology._x000D_

This project aims to advance artificial intelligence methods to identify mosquito species from high resolution images. While well studied and documented, mosquito species identification remains a highly skilled task, where the few capable of this skill for a given region often have many other job responsibilities, making time devoted to the laborious task of mosquito identification difficult to justify at scale, despite the necessity of the data created.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is centered around the problem of mosquito species identification. There are more than 3,000 species of mosquitoes in the world, each with different behaviors and capacities for carrying disease. Regionally trained taxonomic experts can identify them through visual inspection, but there is a shortage of such experts. Some artificial intelligence (AI) methods for image-based identification have already been developed, but they are only designed for a limited number of species and face issues due to complex mosquito morphology and the variability incurred in practical use by vector control organizations. This project seeks to enhance existing methodologies for artificial intelligence (AI)-based insect identification by making use of generative models to address issues in training datasets caused by sampling biases. These models will be used to modulate the presence of underrepresented attributes to make a more robust and less biased model. The generative models used for this task will also be used to translate the data for viability in one constrained image domain to another. The final task is to use these models to modulate the training datasets for closely related mosquito species to fine tune performance for minute, but important, distinctions._x000D_

Chronic pain is associated with substantial suffering and other co-morbidities such as depression, insomnia,
fatigue, lowered mobility, and worse quality-of-life. Most of the care of chronic pain patients occurs during
hurried primary care visits with pharmacological treatments (e.g. opioids and medications) despite mixed
evidence of efficacy and increased risk of potentially dangerous side effects, including addiction and death.
Even when these treatments are effective in reducing pain, they may not improve mental and functional status
and may actually increase depression. The need for easy access to evidence-based non-pharmacological
treatment options that include patient information and skill building would be helpful to chronic pain patients.
To address the need for non-pharmacological approaches to treating chronic pain, we proposed developing
the GEMINI platform to facilitate the delivery of online Integrative Medical Group Visits (IMGV) via video
conferencing, eliminating a major access barrier for patients with physical and/or practical limitations that
prohibit attending weekly in-person sessions. Between the online group sessions, patients use GEMINI for
mind-body home practice with the ability to select evidence-based self-care practice options based on their
own preferences and symptoms, and to gain peer support from group-based activities. The home practice and
self-management tools covering such topics as mindfulness, mind-body practices, self-management of chronic
pain, stress reduction, sleep, and nutrition. For patients, GEMINI is a unique and secure group-based
intervention, uses gamification to reward engagement, and allows users to individualize self-management
tools. For clinicians and researchers, GEMINI also has a Provider Portal, which uses daily measure tracking
and enables monitoring of patients’ symptoms, adherence to home practice, and social interactions.
Aim 1: Enhance/refine Phase I prototype based on Phase I feedback and add implementation of mostly
administrative features for managing/scheduling group visits, updating intervention content, and FHIR/SMART-
based EHR integration. A small pilot test will be conducted before starting the trial in Aim 2. Trial-related
features will be implemented first and then the software used for the trial will be “locked.” Additional feature
implementation will continue after the start of the trial, but on s separate codebase.
Aim 2: Conduct a randomized 2-arm controlled trial (N=212) to test our hypotheses that the use of the GEMINI
intervention would result in reduced pain impact, better pain-related outcomes, improved self-efficacy in pain
management, and reduced pain medication use, as compared to the comparator control group, for up to 6
months from the start of the intervention participation."

Project Summary/Abstract
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in North America (1). Hepatic
steatosis (HS) is the hallmark of NAFLD (2). NAFLD may transition in sub-groups to chronic inflammation (non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), and ultimately to cirrhosis. HS is prevalent in all stages of NAFLD. 3-10% of
all children in the US and 40-70% of obese children have HS (3). There are approximately 15 million obese
children in the US (4), meaning that as many as 10 million youths have HS. Pediatric HS is associated with
premature mortality due to type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and progressive liver disease
in early adulthood (5,6). Successful treatment of pediatric HS is therefore central to long-term metabolic and
cardiovascular health. Recommended options are largely limited to behavioral modifications (i.e., weight loss
and exercise) and nutritional supplement with Vitamin E (3,5-7). There is no FDA-approved drug for the
treatment of NAFLD in individuals of any age.We propose to perform a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in youths with HS. We will expand our previous
study in which treatment with our essential amino acid (EAA)-based composition called AMS2392 reduced liver
fat in adolescent females with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Specific Aim 1. We will investigate the hypothesis that 8 weeks of treatment with AMS2392 will reduce liver fat
in youths with HS. We will perform a double-blind RCT in 48 male and female youths 13 to 18 years of age
(Tanner stage 4 or 5) with biopsy-documented HS. Liver fat content will be measured by magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) at the outset and after the eight-week intervention.
Specific Aim 2. We propose that secondary end points of liver stiffness, body composition, insulin sensitivity,
and plasma concentrations of very-low density triglycerides (VLDL-TG), alanine transaminase (ALT), ApoB100,
creatinine and insulin sensitivity will be improved in the group receiving AMS2392 as compared to placebo.
Specific Aim 3. Adherence to protocol will be greater than 90% and there will be no adverse events in those
consuming AMS2392, including no change in plasma glutathione concentration.Completion of this RCT will provide information regarding efficacy, effect size, safety and tolerance that
will position us to successfully market AMS2392 as a medical nutrition product."

artificial intelligence (AI) software as medical device (SaMD) for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) diagnosis.
ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide, with approximately 50,000 babies going blind
annually, most of which is preventable with accurate and timely diagnosis. The i-ROP DL algorithm was
developed by the i-ROP research consortium and has been shown to provide expert-level diagnosis of plus
disease, a component of severe ROP, based on images from the Retcam (Natus, Middleton, WI) digital fundus
camera. The output is a vascular severity score (VSS) that corresponds to spectrum of plus disease, as defined
by the International Classification of ROP, and has been endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as
an appropriate output for an ROP SaMD. If incorporated into a clinical workflow, this technology could provide
automated, immediate, expert-level diagnosis of ROP to the bedside, solving one of the key gaps in care that
results in preventable blindness worldwide. The first aim of this project is to update and retrain the i-ROP DL
algorithm to improve speed and repeatability for clinical use, finalize the image quality and pre-processing
pipeline, and integrate it into the iTeleGEN data management system, an ROP telemedicine software platform.
The second aim is to perform the necessary clinical studies for the two proposed indications for use (IFU): The
first IFU will be as an assistive diagnostic study to improve the clinical diagnosis of plus disease with regulatory
approval based on a multi-reader multi-case study with a primary outcome of improved diagnosis of plus disease,
based on a five expert reference standard diagnosis, with the use of the VSS. The second IFU will be for
autonomous ROP screening for more than mild ROP (MTMROP, defined as type 2 or worse according to the
Early Treatment for ROP study definition). The pivotal study will have a primary outcome of 85% sensitivity and
85% specificity for the diagnosis of MTMROP, with a secondary outcome of greater than 95% sensitivity for
detection of treatment-requiring ROP. The third aim of the proposal is to validate the i-ROP DL algorithm on a
digital fundus camera made by Forus Health (Bengaluru, India), a digital eye care company, with ROP camera
distribution in more than 20 countries. If successful, then once FDA approval is obtained on the Retcam it may
be extended through a 510K process to a camera that is more affordable than the Retcam and widely available
in low- and middle-income countries. This work will be done by Siloam Vision, a company started by two of the

In this SBIR grant proposal, “Ultra-low distortion and noise electronics to enable a clinical MPI imaging platform,”
we will develop the RF subsystem for a clinical magnetic particle imaging (MPI) platform to enable three classes
of MPI applications: cell tracking, functional imaging, and endogenous contrast imaging. Our overall approach is
to improve sensitivity and resolution by minimizing distortion, adding transmit/receive channels, decoupling,
improving preamplifiers, and developing new pulse sequences.MPI is an emerging molecular and tracer imaging technology that directly detects magnetic nanoparticles
(MNPs) with high sensitivity at mm-scale resolutions. MPI images are direct views of tracer distribution with no
signal arising from tissue, no perturbations from materials such as air, and image intensity directly linear with
tracer concentration. This “hot-spot” contrast provides spatial localization and quantification without ambiguity.
MPI’s contrast is similar to nuclear medicine but without the workflow, safety, and half-life limitations of a
radioactive tracer. MPI has many applications in the brain and body, as demonstrated by our customers in small
animals. Despite significant efforts by multiple institutions, the lack of a clinical MPI scanner remains a significant
limitation for the technique.In this Direct to Phase II SBIR proposal, we will advance the medical imaging field by building the world’s
first general-purpose clinical MPI scanner to serve the myriad applications our customers are testing on our
preclinical instrument. We will design and implement a new transmit/receive subsystem and install it in our
prototype scanner to achieve the performance necessary for clinical imaging applications. This new
transmit/receive subsystem includes the following innovations that push our sensitivity from our current rough
prototype to near the physics limit through the following specific aims:Aim 1. Drive transmit distortion and the noise floor to the physics limit for a one-channel Tx/Rx coilAim 2. Design a clinical multi-channel transmit and receive subsystemAim 3. Develop new acquisition pulse sequences to improve sensitivity, resolution, and speed"

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating disease and there is no current curative treatment, with insulin being
the only product available. T1D affects not only glycemic control but also many important aspects of a patient's
life, including emotional well-being, quality of life, working ability, and social interactions29. In addition, persons
with T1D present increased risk of developing other serious complications. Therefore, there is an urgent need
to develop new cutting-edge strategies for T1D management.
The steep rise in the incidence and prevalence of T1D cannot be explained solely by genetic factors
implicating the environment, and specifically the gut microbiome, as a culprit for the disease
etiopathogenesis45. The gut microbiome influences multiple host functions, including immunity, and persons
with T1D present changes in gut microbiota associated with immunological deregulation and gut leakiness6.
Clinical studies demonstrate that fecal microbiome therapy (FMT) and probiotics can halt the progression of
new onset T1D13, corroborating the importance of the gut microbiome.
A promising and safe approach for the treatment of T1D that leverages the body’s own natural microbiome-
associated immune regulatory mechanisms is the use of resistant starches. High amylose starch (HAMS) is a
well-tolerated source of dietary fiber that modulate the gut microbiome and the host immune response. HAMS
consumption shifts the gut microbiome profile towards dietary fiber fermenters, producing the beneficial short
chain fatty acids SCFAs. However, HAMS only partially ameliorates T1D in humans. A potentially better
strategy is to use HAMS that has been esterified, releasing larger amounts of SCFAs in the intestinal tract and
eventually the circulation. Rise Therapeutics is developing R-5280, a modified version of HAMS that has been
butyrylated and acetylated. In our prior Phase 1 clinical trial enrolling adolescents with recent onset of T1D,
oral administration of R-5280 increased SCFA production leading to improved overall glycemic control. In
addition, R-5280 consumption resulted in significant increases in specific beneficial metabolites, and reduction
of inflammatory T cells. Given the limited success of prior therapeutic strategies and potential long-term risks of
immunomodulatory therapies in patients with T1D, the use of a microbiome modulating therapy like R-5280
offers a simple, safe, and inexpensive alternative approach to mitigating this devastating disease.
The goal of this proposal is to perform a confirmatory double blinded placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of
adolescents with early onset of T1D. The key aims of this proposal are: 1) compounding of R-5280 and
placebo to prepare for patient distribution; 2) execute the Phase 2 clinical trial; and 3) expand biomarker
discovery and characterization. Successful commercialization of R-5280 will provide a profound medical
advancement for treating T1D."

Project Summary:The Specific Aim of this Direct to Phase II project is to develop a discrete, low-profile, dual
hormone artificial pancreas device, the GeminiTM-DHAP, using SFC Fluidics' enabling
microfluidic technologies to deliver both insulin and glucagon as recommended by a dual-hormone
algorithm in response to continuous glucose monitor readings. The Gemini pod uses one
proprietary DualPumpTM body to independently and accurately deliver both insulin and glucagon
from two separate reservoirs. Safety valve sets independently and safely control the delivery of
each hormone, and a dispense confirmation sensor notifies the user of any dosing errors resulting
from occlusions or electrical/mechanical failures. Phase II will focus on optimization and design
freeze of the Gemini pod followed by integration of the Gemini pod with a CGM and dual-hormone
algorithm into a DHAP system and extensive benchtop and animal model testing. The project will
culminate with an IDE submission in preparation for future clinical trials. Throughout the project
SFC will collaborate with its university subcontractors, established medical, regulatory and
manufacturing consultants, GMP-compliant pod component manufacturing partner, and the Food
and Drug Administration to streamline commercialization of the Gemini-DHAP. By the end of
Phase II, SFC Fluidics will be well positioned to raise the additional funding necessary for early-
stage clinical trials and subsequent pivotal trials to obtain PMA-approval of the Gemini-DHAP.
This project is in direct response to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases for “development of
improved insulin and other pancreatic hormone delivery devices and methods” and is particularly
relevant in 2023 due to the increased risk for Covid 19 and other infections that results from poor
glycemic control."

uses the application of precision acoustic fields to penetrating neural implants to prevent electrode impedance
rise and improve implant longevity. This submission is in response to: Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): NOT-
MH-21-125 Translation of BRAIN Initiative Technologies to the Marketplace.
Problem to be solved: Chronic neural implants hold great potential for illuminating features of neural function,
treating neurological disorders, and enabling the next generation of brain-machine interface-based
neuroprosthetics. Penetrating microelectrode arrays provide direct access to neural signals with high
temporospatial resolution. However, their preclinical and clinical viability are limited by their poor longevity and
variability in functionality due to the immune response or foreign body response (FBR). The FBR can cause
glial scarring and neural cell loss near the electrode sites of penetrating arrays over a period of several weeks,
which are leading causes of signal recording losses through both electrical isolation and spatial distancing
effects. The FBR begins with electrode insertion, when damage to the blood brain barrier activates astrocytes
and microglia. Although ‘soft’ electrode materials, thinner shanks, and floating arrays have been developed to
minimize the mismatch between brain and implant, none of these have demonstrated sufficient recording life
and immunity to the FBR. Exogenous chemical means have been used to directly suppress the FBR, and
have yielded positive results to varying degrees, but limitations of effectiveness, high costs, and/or undesirable
side-effects still exist. A simple approach is needed to mitigate FBR for both preclinical and clinical use.
Solution: Sub-threshold therapeutic ultrasound has recently been shown to have protective and healing effects
in models of cerebral disease and injury, through promotion of neurotrophic factors. AMI successfully
leveraged this principle in an R21 study evaluating low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) to mitigate the
microglia response and improve longevity of neural interfaces. Product: This Fast-track delivers an AIP
system for preclinical use with a reusable (releasable) annular transducer that delivers LIPUS to produce a
neuro-protective environment around implanted microelectrodes.
Phase I: Aim 1 – Electronics/System Adaptation for Preclinical Study. Aim 2 – Confirm ultrasound parameters
for AIP annulus that safely stimulate cortical tissues comparable to Alpha design from R21.
Phase I to Phase II Go-no-go. Portable, reusable AIP prototype produces measurable improvement in neural
signal longevity over 6 weeks in preclinical microelectrode study. Positive feedback from potential end users.
Aim 3– Integrate End User Design Feedback and Conduct Verification and Validation. Aim 4 – Optimize
stimulation intervals for neural interface performance (SNR, unit detection) and demonstrate additional neuro-
protective effects (glial cell activation, E-I balance) of LIPUS in preclinical studies."

prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), its most serious and costly complication. Prevention of BPD is the
focus of this Phase IIB/SMA application and a NHLBI topic of specific interest under this FOA, RFA-HL-23-008.
We will be building on the very significant data supported by our Phase I/II SBIR award with our innovative
inhaled vitA formulation that: 1) avoids the drawbacks of invasive intramuscular (IM) injections and absorption
limitations of current oral forms, overcoming significant hurdles for routine NICU utilization, and 2) provides direct-
to-target-organ delivery for increased efficacy- our in vivo data show significant benefit over IM dosing in
mitigating hyperoxic lung damage (in our BPD animal model), while providing adequate systemic delivery to also
treat VAD as discussed in the Research Strategy and in our recent publication (47).In collaboration with Dr. Virender Rehan at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, we have completed all Phase I
Specific Aims and are wrapping up Phase II Aims, demonstrating that inhaled vitA: 1) stimulates lung maturation
(assay of lung biomarkers showing upregulation of retinol receptors, surfactant protein and phospholipid
synthesis, as well as maturation biomarkers, while simultaneously raising serum vitA levels similar to IM dosing);
2) dramatically (vs IM) reduces hyperoxic lung tissue damage (assessment of lung tissue histomorphometry and
reduction of lung-injury biomarkers); and 3) preserves pulmonary function (preliminary longer-term PFT data).In Phase IIB, we will further refine inhaled vitA dosing strategies for mitigating hyperoxic lung damage (BPD
prevention) in a step-wise approach by studying the well characterized premature lamb BPD model and proceed
with IND-enabling activities to be ready to begin first-in-man clinical studies in preterm infants at risk for
development of BPD. Phase IIb Specific Aims are: 1: Optimization of the dosing regimen of aerosolized vitA
for mitigating hyperoxic lung damage in a premature lamb BPD model, focusing on both the “neonatal” (acute

morphologic, and PFT evaluation as per Phase I/II. Aim 2: proceeding with drug manufacturing development
and scale-up of our formulation under stringent GLP and GMP controls. Aim 3: conducting GLP toxicology
studies in both small (rat) and large (dog) species to support clinic-readiness. Measures of success will be
generation of data supporting further development of our novel non-invasive therapy for preventing BPD (and
treating VAD), including a vitA formulation that meets adequate CMC requirements to proceed into the clinic,
and completion of GLP toxicology showing adequate safety for first-in-man studies in at-risk preterm neonates."

Kennedy’s disease, also known as spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), is a progressive
neurodegenerative disease caused by genetic polyglutamine expansion in the N-terminal domain
(NTD) of the androgen receptor (AR). Recent research has shown that the mutant AR protein
misfolds, aggregates, and abnormally interacts with other proteins, leading to androgen-
dependent lower motor neuron degeneration and skeletal muscle atrophy. Currently, there are
no treatments available to slow, stop or even reverse the progression of SBMA, therefore, the
unmet medical need is high to discover novel therapeutic agents. The AR pathway is a very
important area being studied in SBMA. Experimental studies for the treatment of SBMA have
focused on interaction of the AR with testosterone. Removing testosterone via castration in animal
models appears to be protective and restores some lost function. AR knockout in SBMA patient-
derived stem cells differentiated into neurons reverses the neurotoxic effects of the mutant AR.
This led to the use of anti-androgenic therapies for SBMA treatment. Our awarded Phase 1 SBIR
grant to evaluate our NTD-binding selective AR antagonists and degraders (DAARIs) in preclinical
models of SBMA has provided strong in vivo data that support the submission of this Phase 2
application to continue the preclinical development of ONCT-505 a potential SBMA therapy.
Our objective is to generate certain data for ONCT-505 that will ultimately support the submission
of an investigational new drug (IND)-application. ONCT-505 has been studied in various
preclinical models of AR-dependent diseases, including SBMA and advanced prostate cancer.
Importantly, ONCT-505, unlike any other molecule targeting the AR, binds to the AR activation
function-1 (AF-1) domain in the NTD and leads to signaling antagonism and ultimately AR protein
degradation via ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. ONCT-505 is orally bioavailable with
pharmacokinetic (PK) and drug-like properties suitable for drug development and demonstrated
efficacy in SBMA preclinical models better than surgical castration. The molecule did not show
overt toxicity up to 200 times the ED50 (effective dose of 50% observed efficacy) in pilot toxicology
studies and also lacks cross-reactivity with other proteins. These properties make ONCT-505 an
ideal candidate for further evaluation as potential small molecule therapeutic for patients suffering
from SBMA.
Successful completion of the outlined studies will result in a clinical drug candidate with
demonstrated preclinical efficacy, well-documented safety profile, and scalable GMP-compatible
manufacturing process."

The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementia (AD/ADRD) is expected to nearly triple to a
staggering 13 million affected Americans and the total costs of care are projected to increase five-fold to 1.1
trillion dollars by the year 2050. Early detection of precursor stages of AD/ADRD becomes extremely important,
as it can introduce treatment or intervention earlier for potential AD/ADRD patients, given existing treatments
only have modest benefit at best. Early cognitive decline of patients is often under diagnosed by primary care
physicians (PCPs). A clinical decision support (CDS) tool that can automatically detect cognitive decline signals
from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) and facilitate PCPs to make timely diagnoses would be highly
desirable, as it would result in early intervention for potential AD/ADRD patients. In our Phase I Equivalent work
at Harvard Medical School, we have developed a deep learning model for earlier detection of cognitive decline
using clinical notes in Mass General Brigham’s EHRs. Here we propose a Direct-to-Phase II study, which further
develops novel deep learning algorithms for the early detection of cognitive decline, implement them into a
clinical decision support tool, and validate the tool in a primary care setting. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop
novel ontology, NLP, and classification approaches to identify patients with early cognitive decline using records
from EHR and extract related evidence from clinical notes. In Aim 2, we will work with frontline physicians to
design, develop and evaluate a user-centered clinical decision support tool to identify and manage patients with
cognitive decline. The system, which we intend to align with evidence-based frameworks such as the CMS
Collaborative Care Model, will identify patients at risk (with supporting evidence) and prompt personalized
recommendations for timely care. Once the system is developed and fully tested, we will implement the
developed CDS tool in a simulated EHR environment at Mass General Brigham healthcare system, using real
patient data, and formally evaluate its utility and usability by recruiting primary care clinicians. This project will
deliver not only effective models for early detection of cognitive decline, but also a practical and validated CDS
tool that can improve diagnosis of precursor stages of AD/ADRD, thus facilitating early intervention for potential
AD/ADRD patients. If successful, it will be the first study that engages primary care physicians and real patient
data to validate the utility of such a cognitive decline detection tool."

Significance
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20% following
standard of care therapy.
Problem
Despite the use of aggressive surgery, combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy, a major limitation in the
control of primary and metastatic non-small cell pulmonary tumors with the use of the systemic administration of
drugs is the low drug concentration in the lungs due to blood volume dilution and metabolism. There is a critical
unmet medical need to develop new strategies to improve patient treatment outcomes.
Innovation
In contrast to systemic delivery of chemotherapy, inhalation delivers a chemotherapeutic drug directly to tumor
tissues in the lung thereby enhancing its efficacy and safety due to increased local drug concentration in the
lung, decreased systemic drug levels in the circulation, and decreased systemic toxicity.
Gap
Preliminary pre-clinical in-vivo studies using nebulized chemotherapy drugs has demonstrated efficacy and
established the feasibility of delivery via aerosol, but nebulization of toxic drugs has major drawbacks. These
drawbacks include a lack of efficient peripheral airway penetration, high mouth-throat deposition, contamination
of equipment, and collateral aerosol risk to medical staff.
Project Objective
To address these drawbacks, we are developing a new method of delivering a chemotherapeutic drug via
inhalation to reach pulmonary tumors directly in order to maximize the effectiveness and safety of the aerosol
treatment with a fraction of the standard dose. We will create a novel dry powder chemotherapeutic formulation
containing an FDA approved chemotherapy medication for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
Aims
Aims of this proposal will be 1) scale-up the lead Quench EEG formulation and conduct characterization, stability,
and performance studies, and 2) conduct IND-enabling toxicology studies in an established inhalation toxicology
rodent model for regulatory submission.
Commercial Potential
Translation of this technology into a clinically beneficial inhalable chemotherapy product has the potential to
significantly improve the treatment of pulmonary tumors in lung cancer patients by delivering targeted lower
doses of medicine directly to the lung while minimizing systemic toxicity."

Project Summary:
Sepsis is an incompletely understood clinical syndrome characterized by a dysregulated host response to
infection. In partnership with 8 U.S. hospitals, Prenosis amassed one of the world’s largest datasets and biobanks
that combines biomarker and clinical data for patients suspected of infection, housing over 70,000 plasma or
serum samples from over 14,000 patients. We also curated a dataset of dense time-series data from each
patient’s Electronic Medical Record (EMR), including demographics, vitals, lab results, interventions, outcomes,
and many other parameters. To commercialize insights from these data, Prenosis built ImmunixTM, an FHR/HL7
compatible software platform for clinical deployment of diagnostics and clinical decision support tools.
Under a previously awarded NIGMS grant (1R44GM139529), Prenosis built a testing pipeline to measure 40
critical protein biomarkers from biobanked samples. To date, we measured these biomarkers on only the initial
sample per patient for 6,000 patients and combined these data with EMR clinical parameters to construct 8
endotypes of sepsis. The identification and classification of endotypes—groupings of patients with similar
biologic and clinical features—is increasingly becoming recognized as a valuable methodologic approach to
assessing patients with sepsis. To complete work for the existing grant, Prenosis will measure the baseline
sample for additional patients to total about 10,000 patients to refine and validate the endotypes.
In this project, Prenosis proposes to add a critical new dimension to the data by assaying and analyzing
longitudinal, time-series biomarker data. We will leverage our pipeline to measure the 40 core biomarkers from
9,000 follow-up samples from ~3,400 patients that we have already collected and stored in the biobank. We
will assess the additional value of longitudinal time-series biomarker measurements and clinical data. Initial
feasibility data from over 1,000 measured samples demonstrates that longitudinal data provide additional
powerful new biologic and prognostic insights. Analytics built upon these data have the potential to improve
diagnostic and drug development products for sepsis and COVID. The overall hypothesis of this project is that
longitudinal biomarkers will add a valuable biologic and prognostic dimension to endotypes for sepsis; and these
longitudinal endotypes will better classify patients who may have a heterogeneous response to sepsis therapies."

The proposed project focuses on creating a simulation system that provides hands-on skills training of
musculoskeletal, soft tissue, and ligament function for medical and health science students. Significance:
Musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders are the most frequent chronic health problems in the United States. Despite
this reality, education in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of MSK disorders and injuries is
underrepresented in entry level training and postgraduate residency programs leaving primary care providers
underprepared. Multiple studies have confirmed that students lack competency in this domain, having difficulty
performing and interpreting the results of MSK examinations, leading to reduced patient outcomes.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the creation and availability of a new simulation system can address this
problem by supporting enhanced learning interactions and increasing knowledge transfer for clinical education.
Specific Aims: A Fast-Track project is proposed where the Phase I aims will be to: 1) Consult with expert
advisory panel and perform final independent evaluation, 2) Prototype knee joint mannequin
materials/mechanical design, and 3) Develop simulation electronics and functionality. If the Phase I meets its
transition criteria of success the follow-on Phase II program will: 1) Collect expert feedback on design and
educational utility, 2) Perform additional skeletal/joint engineering and implement a suite of simulation curricula,

prevent acute tissue damage and chronic pathologies resulting from exposure to ionizing radiation from an
accidental or terroristic event. Radiation induces inflammatory cytokines that promote tissue damage including
Gastrointestinal Acute Radiation Syndrome (GI-ARS). Because there are no approved drugs to prevent GI-ARS,
there is an intense need for new drugs for therapy following exposure to radiation. Sphingolipids, particularly
ceramides and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), regulate GI epithelial cell survival, the DNA damage response,
and responses to inflammatory cytokines. Synthesis of S1P is dependent on sphingosine kinase (SK1 and SK2)
activity, and so SKs are rational new molecular targets to mitigate GI-ARS. Apogee has developed the first-in-
class Investigational New Drug opaganib (previously called ABC294640). Opaganib is the only clinical-stage
inhibitor of SK2 and has broad anticancer and anti-inflammatory efficacy in preclinical models. Phase 1 clinical
trials of orally-administered opaganib to patients with advanced solid tumors or multiple myeloma are complete,
and Phase 2 clinical trials of opaganib in patients with prostate cancer or cholangiocarcinoma are in progress.
Additionally, opaganib improved clinical outcome for highly compromised patients with severe Covid-19. To date,
opaganib has been administered to rt470 patients with a favorable safety profile.Because GI-ARS is mediated by epithelial cell apoptosis and excessive inflammation, processes regulated
by sphingolipids, we hypothesized that opaganib will decrease GI damage from radiation exposure leading to
mitigation of GI-ARS and improved survival. In Proof-of-Concept studies supported by the Biomedical Advanced
Research and Development Authority and the Department of Defense, we demonstrated that oral opaganib
provides highly significant protection against mortality from GI-ARS in mice following irradiation in a 5% bone
marrow-shielded model. Opaganib increased survival when administered either prior to radiation or 24 hr after
radiation exposure and was efficacious at levels that have been demonstrate safe in human trials.In a pre-IND meeting, the FDA encouraged the continue development of opaganib as an MCM for GI-ARS
under the Animal Rule for regulatory approval. Specific requirements for approval were identified, and are
addressed in the following Specific Aims for this Phase 2 SBIR project: 1. Definition of the biochemical
mechanism(s) for protection against radiation-induced cell death and inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells; 2.
Definition of the effect of radiation exposure on the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of orally-administered opaganib; and
3. Identification of assessable pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers for opaganib for future pivotal animal studies
and human clinical trials. The studies proposed herein follow FDA guidance for approval under the Animal Rule
and will enable continued advancement of opaganib as an MCM for GI-ARS."

Language access solutions in healthcare have focused almost exclusively on the provision of verbal medical
interpretation, despite federal and state laws that mandate translation of written information for patients with
limited English proficiency (LEP). In recent years, machine translation (MT) has made significant strides, but
when it comes to mission-critical technical materials such as healthcare information, the accuracy rate of
machine-only translations plummets. Thus, experts recommend MT as a starting point for translating
health-related material then supplementing with human quality assurance editing. However, coordinating
machine translation with bilingual human editors who have technical medical knowledge is a challenge,
especially for less commonly supported languages. Translation vendors currently pass on the associated costs
of human assistance to healthcare institutions. The Canopy Translate project will address these deficits by
implementing a novel, human-assisted machine translation (HAMT) process. The envisioned workflow
management platform will leverage MT engines to expedite the initial rendering of source documents into a
target language, then invite bilingual healthcare professionals around the world to apply human editing to the
machine-generated translation. The bilingual contributors, who will gain complimentary access to our Medical
English eLearning courses as an incentive for their participation, will complete the editing task through gamified
learning exercises. For example, a nurse in the Philippines has native fluency in Tagalog and advanced
general English but desires to improve his medical English. He can edit a machine-generated Tagalog
translation one sentence at a time in the form of a gamified activity. Other contributors will edit the same text for
additional quality assurance to form the final, polished version in Tagalog. The system will then organize the
final translated content into a reusable document library. In Phase I, we will test the feasibility of this hybrid
HAMT approach for medical content. Upon meeting feasibility benchmarks, we will advance to Phase II, during
which we will create a minimum viable product, encompassing several novel natural language processing
(NLP) algorithms, and evaluate the translation output according to a set of quality benchmarks. If successful,
this project will significantly improve the availability, speed, and cost-effectiveness of producing multilingual
health content, with potential to reduce health disparities in LEP populations."

Treatment of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is limited to palliative and
cytoreductive agents that mitigate proliferative blood counts and their effects. Small molecule
selective tyrosine kinase (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors were also shown to provide modest patient benefit,
including reduced symptomatology and improved quality of life. Despite the available therapies,
survival remains poor in patients with advanced forms of MPN, and some patients inevitably become
refractory to all available therapies. Consequently, there is an unmet medical need for a new drug
that can safely mitigate MPN symptoms and, ideally, also alter the long-term course of the disease.
To address this important need, we propose to develop and investigate the therapeutic potential of
Aronora’s proprietary drug candidate AB062, a thrombopoietin conjugate antisense oligonucleotide
(THPO-ASO), to be used alone or in addition to other drugs, as a novel therapeutic for chronic
myeloproliferative disorders. Our THPO-ASO inhibits hepatic thrombopoietin gene transcription in
both murine and primate models, reduces serum thrombopoietin (TPO) levels, and results in dose-
dependent reduction of TPO concentration-dependent downstream cellular effects. Work by our co-
investigators and others has shown that TPO deprivation predominantly results in depletion of certain
TPO-dependent mutant JAK2 carrier MPN stem cells while sparing healthy bone marrow progenitors.
Targeting THPO/MPL/JAK2 axis also mitigates the MPN phenotype in murine MPN models, including
reduction in proliferative blood counts and splenomegaly. These observations support our hypothesis
that THPO-ASO could favorably alter the natural trajectory of certain MPNs. Our objective for Phase I
of this SBIR Fast-Track project is to confirm that murine THPO-ASO treatment alone [or in
combination with the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib,] can improve disease outcomes in a transgenic
murine MPN model. Upon reaching this milestone, we will extend these studies into Phase II by: 1)
evaluating murine THPO-ASO in a murine MPN transplant model that will allow us to assess the
effects of THPO-ASO on the malignant clonal burden, 2) evaluating the reversibility of THPO-ASO
and assess for synergy with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitnib, and 3) screen for and manufacture AB062, a
drug-candidate ASO that targets human THPO. Positive results will justify further commercial
development, and will help support an Investigational New Drug application for evaluating AB062 in
patients with advanced myeloproliferative disorders who are in desperate need of new and innovative
therapies."
"Enabling rapid and effective stroke thrombectomy procedures from a Transradial approach: Combining introducer sheath, guide catheter, and distal access catheter into a single device.","PIRAEUS MEDICAL, INC.",HHS,NIH,SBIR,"Phase II",R44NS122602,2R44NS122602-02,"September 29, 2023","June 30, 2025",992721,2023,100,PA22-176,2022,"753 FOX CHASE RD SW",,ROCHESTER,MN,55902-8749,USA,4,,HJLCXM3LFXB5,128420207,N,N,N,"JARED  HUTAR",,"(218) 340-7338",jhutar12@gmail.com,"KEVIN  KALLMES",,"(507) 271-7051",kall0156@umn.edu,,"  ",,,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal will improve the care of patients suffering from Acute Ischemic stroke (AIS). Catheter-based
thrombectomy has been established as the standard treatment for AIS. Still, substantial limitations remain: lt50%
of patients achieve first-pass clot clearance, the best predictor of good neurological outcome, largely due to
shortcomings in the approach (transfemoral access [TFA]) and the current catheters used to aspirate clots.
Given the advanced age of many or most thrombectomy candidates, highly tortuous vessels are frequently
encountered when traversing from the femoral to carotid territories. It has been shown that substantial
tortuosity leads to worse outcomes in TFA procedures. Thus, many leading interventionalists have proposed
transradial access (TRA) in place of transfemoral access. TRA is already the preferred access site for the vast
majority of interventional cardiology procedures, given low rates of bleeding complications and ready access to
the coronary circulation. The radial site also provides ready access to the cerebral vasculature, bypassing
tortuosity along the aortic arch, descending aorta, and ilio-femoral system. However, neurointerventionalists
who use TRA are stuck employing femoral guide sheaths (such as the Ballast or Neuron Max), which are not
designed for the radial-to-intracranial navigation and which have safety concerns due to the vasospasm or
radial artery occlusion that can result from their imperfect adaptation to TRA.
A parallel advancement in neurointervention is that of SuperBore Distal Access Catheters (DACs) used to
efficiently pull out clots from arteries of patients suffering from AIS. These SuperBore DACs provide large
lumens (increasing suction by rt30% over conventional DACs), but struggle with navigation challenges in
tortuous anatomies, with nearly half of procedures resulting in failure to navigate to the clot face. While they
provide a major advance in DAC sizing, SuperBores have not been considered for TRA approaches due to
their thick walls and stiff tips, precluding the ability to achieve optimized navigation or suction power from the
radial approach. Our team discovered this pressing need after achieving acquisition by Medtronic of our
previous SBIR-funded program via intensive interviews of 50+ physicians.
In our successful Phase I project, we developed and tested our novel SuperBore thrombectomy system
appropriate for TRA. Specifically, our “Wrist-to-Brain” thrombectomy system provides the distinct advantages
of: (1) combining guide catheter and SuperBore DAC in a single catheter, (2) hyperthin walls enabled by our
novel, proprietary liner, and (3) a highly trackable and kink resistant shaft that still fits within the radial artery in
most patients. In this Phase II SBIR program, we propose a full, formal validation program guided by FDA
testing criteria (Aim 1), followed by extensive benchtop, GLP animal, and cadaveric testing (Aim 2). This grant
will enable us to complete all testing needed to submit for FDA clearance and begin marketing our novel and
impactful Wrist-to-Brain thrombectomy system in order to improve the care of patients suffering from LVO AIS."
"Using Structured Light Sensing with Machine Learning to Detect Unwitnessed In-Home Falls","APPLIED UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS, CORP",HHS,NIH,SBIR,"Phase II",R44AG066263,2R44AG066263-02A1,"September 30, 2023","August 31, 2026",768585,2023,NIA,PAS22-196,2022,"23875 CHESTNUT DR",,LORETTO,MN,55357-9536,USA,3,,FX3HURWMGC21,080808144,N,N,N,"PAUL  GIBSON",,"(612) 470-9532",paul@audynamics.com,"PAUL  GIBSON",,"(612) 470-9532",paul@audynamics.com,,"  ",,,"Project Summary/Abstract
Older adults are disproportionately affected by falls. Older adults who have memory loss (mild to moderate
cognitive impairment) can forget to wear wireless alert pendants or wristbands that are used in case they fall in
their home. Falls among adults 65 and older caused over 34,000 deaths in 2019, making it the leading cause
of injury death for that group. Older adult falls cost $50 billion in medical costs annually. Of those who fall,
many suffer serious injuries, such as hip fractures and head traumas, which reduces their mobility,
independence, and life expectancy. Studies have found an increased risk of complications associated with
prolonged periods of lying on the floor following a fall. Older adults living alone or with memory loss are at the
greatest risk of delayed assistance following a fall and cannot always be counted on to use their wearable
emergency alert button. A low-cost, unobtrusive system capable of automatically detecting and alerting falls in
the homes of older adults living alone or those with mild to moderate cognitive impairment, could help
significantly reduce the incidence of delayed assistance after a fall.
This phase II project, building on a successful phase I project, will develop an innovative new in-home fall
monitoring system that solves many practical problems with existing systems. The technical approach uses
structured light sensing (SLS) that creates 3D point clouds of a scene to allow detection of motion sequences
using machine learning (ML) algorithms which will allow for the automatic detection of a person’s fall. There are
multiple benefits of this approach for the target users: 1. The person is not required to carry or wear an
electronic device that might be forgotten to be worn. 2. No action is required to be taken by the person after a
fall. 3. The system does not use visible light video that would create privacy concerns for the person. 4. The
system can work in darkness or very low light unlike visible light camera-based approaches. 5. The system is
unobtrusive and works with existing Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS), with minimal or no
active user interaction.
The SLS fall detection system is intended to work with multiple vendors of in-home alert systems. It will operate
in lieu of or in parallel with, wearable buttons to signal an alert. The proposed system would be used if
caregivers determine that a wearable button is not an adequate solution for the person being monitored. The
proposed devices will be mounted high on the wall of each room and will wirelessly communicate to a central
device in the home. The central device will send the alert to the in-home alert system upon detecting a fall. The
proposed solution will not require any Internet connectivity. The out-of-home communication method is
provided by the chosen vendor of the in-home alert system."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) comprises 80-85% of primary liver cancers and frequently develops in patients
with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B virus infection. HCC's poor prognosis is primarily due to advanced-stage
diagnosis. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend biannual liver ultrasounds, with or without serum
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) testing, for at-risk patients to detect HCC at a curable stage. However, their accuracy is
limited, with sensitivity between 60-70% and specificity of 90%. Consequently, novel biomarkers for early
detection of HCC are urgently needed. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous group of lipid
nanoparticles that are released by all types of cells, and even more so by tumor cells. Tumor-derived EVs are
present in circulation at relatively early stages of disease and are readily accessible across all disease stages.
Since the surface proteins of tumor EVs mirror those of the parental tumor cells and those cells within tumor
microenvironment, exploiting the diagnostic potential of HCC EVs’ surface protein signatures as a novel
biomarker for early detection of HCC holds great promise to significantly augment the ability of current diagnostic
modalities.
Over the last five years, our joint team comprised of Eximius Dx, UCLA, and Cedars Sinai Medical Center
(CSMC) has demonstrated of HCC EV Surface Protein (SP) Test, capable of dissecting and quantifying
subpopulations of HCC EVs in plasma samples. In our 2022 Hepatology paper, we summarized a phase-2
biomarker study which successfully validated the feasibility of HCC EV SP Test for early HCC detection. The
long-term goal of this Direct-to-Phase-II proposal is to advance the development, optimization, and automation
of the HCC EV SP Test, with the ultimate goal of establishing a more sensitive in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test based
on HCC EVs. The innovation of the proposed HCC EV SP Test lies in the integration of two platform technologies:
(i) EV Click MagBeads for click chemistry-mediated capture of subpopulations of HCC EVs, and (ii) real-time
immuno-PCR for quantifying the captured HCC EVs. In parallel, an algorithm will be established to process the
resulting HCC EV signatures into HCC EV SP score for distinguishing early-stage HCC from at-risk cirrhosis.
This new IVD test will use less then 1-mL plasma and have a sample-to-answer workflow of no more than 3
hours. By adopting an in-house developed robotic system, the automated workflow allows for a throughput rt
480 samples per round. Once optimized and automated the HCC EV SP Test will be validated by clinically
annotated plasma samples to assess its diagnostic performance for distinguishing early-stage HCC from at-risk
liver cirrhotic patients, covering etiologies including alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD), and viral hepatitis (B/C). The successful development of the proposed HCC EV SP Test
is rapidly translatable, enabling a sensitive HCC EV-based IVD test for detecting early-stage HCC."

Current therapies for sickle cell disease largely fail to meet patient needs, particularly for the management of
acute pain crisis associated with this devastating disease. Healthcare systems are largely ill-equipped for
managing patients in the midst of these extremely painful and life-threatening events, leaving patients with
medical distrust and no effective treatment option. We are therefore developing IHP-100 for at-home self-
management of pain crisis, thus empowering patients and providing significant freedom from disease. IHP-100
is a novel P-selectin and complement inhibitor that is administered by subcutaneous injection at the onset of
early symptoms of pain crisis. This is a major paradigm shift in care that builds on our recent understanding of
sickle cell pathology and incorporates direct patient feedback to provide a truly effective treatment.
IHP-100 is a novel glycan-based therapeutic, designed to target the key underlying pathology of vaso-occlusive
crisis (VOC). VOC is multi-factorial and includes both cellular adhesion via selectins as well as complement
activation. Glycans are a prime drug class for such complex pathologies given their pleiotropic activities. We
have therefore engineered IHP-100 as a single agent that potently inhibits P-selectin as well as complement.
IHP-100 is therefore highly differentiated both in its biological activity and in its treatment paradigm at the earliest
symptom of pain crisis.
We have shown that IHP-100 inhibits P-selectin mediated cell binding to inflamed endothelium, inhibits
complement-mediated cell lysis, and reduces vaso-occlusions in the Townes sickle cell disease mouse model
of VOC. In the proposed work, we will optimize the dose level for in vivo efficacy, transfer manufacturing and
analytical testing to a GMP facility, and complete non-clinical IND enabling dose-range finding studies. We will
also further investigate mechanisms of IHP-100 in a P-selectin-deficient Townes sickle cell mouse model, and
establish an adhesion-based biomarker strategy for clinical development."

Physician IB compromises the quality of patient-physician communication, eroding trust and
confidence, impairing treatment decisions and adherence, and causing patient harm. Studies
show that non-Black physicians, on average, have moderate levels of IB toward Black patients.
Since most Black patients see non-Black physicians, this means that most Black patients see
physicians with IB towards them. The main way in which IB is communicated and reinforced is
via paraverbal behaviors (i.e., how people deliver speech, such as tone, pitch, volume) and non-
verbal behaviors (i.e., how people use their body, such as eye gaze, hand gestures, and body
leaning), as opposed to verbal behaviors (i.e., what people say) during interactions. Current IB
training is ineffective because they rely on relatively brief interventions that seek only to in-
crease physicians’ awareness about their having IB. While this is a necessary first step, by itself
it is insufficient. IB training must also show learners the behaviors they unwittingly display due to
their IB, and teach them concrete remediation strategies.
MCI’s work under this grant will produce the first-ever effective IB training system. MPathic-
IBCH is a new AI-based technology that will enhance two-way communication using adaptable
virtual human (VH) interactions, and present detailed, actionable, personalized feedback on
learners’ unwitting display of negative nonverbal and paraverbal behaviors. To recognize se-
lected facial expressions associated with learner IB, MCI will implement a proprietary system
based on the Emotion Facial Action Coding System (EMFACS) which analyzes combinations of
facial action units for real-time emotional state analysis. We will further enhance the responsive-
ness of VHs with an EMFACS-based facial rigging design that parallels the detection design.
This SBIR FastTrack will accomplish this by: (Ph1-1) Identifying key paraverbal and nonver-
bal communication behaviors systematically associated with pro-White/anti-Black IB. (PH1-2)

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a significant, worldwide health problem affecting an estimated 14 million
people in the US. It is characterized by hepatic inflammation and injury and fibrosis. Subjects diagnosed with
NASH are at significantly increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Without any currently available FDA approved treatments, NASH has become a significant unmet medical need.
In NASH patients, lipid accumulation along with generation of lipotoxic intermediates leads to the induction of
cell stress triggering apoptotic, inflammatory, and fibrotic signaling pathways. Reactive aldehydes, the product
of oxidative modification (i.e. peroxidation) of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), can bind proteins by indirect
or secondary protein modification, resulting in an increased risk for aggregation, loss of function, and cell
damage. Published evidence points to the critical role of 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), the most abundant reactive
aldehyde, contributing to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH. 4-HNE has
been implicated as a specific driver of multiple pathways in NASH etiology including: a) loss of insulin inhibition
of adipocyte lipolytic activity leading to increased fatty acid flux to the liver and generation of lipotoxic products,
b) direct activation of inflammatory pathways, and c) as the direct driver of hepatic stellate cell activation and
liver fibrosis. While 4-HNE production results from lipid peroxidation, the ability to control its levels by
endogenous or exogenous antioxidants is limited; lipophilic reservoirs can provide a long-lasting discharge of 4-
HNE beyond the temporal source of oxidant generation. Therefore, controlling 4-HNE levels represents a unique
and novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of NASH.
TamuroBio has synthesized a new chemical entity, TB-019, that is able to act as a nucleophilic scavenger. TB-
019 binds to 4-HNE, thereby reducing its levels in cells and has been shown in two rodent models of NASH to
be effective in reducing liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis progression. TB-019 has favorable physicochemical
and ADME properties, as well as a preliminary good safety profile. This proposal aims to complete IND-enabling
GLP safety and toxicology studies and to produce drug supply for the Phase I first-in human trial. This work will
be performed by high quality contract research organizations in the US, overseen by the experienced team at
TamuroBio.
In summary, the overall goal of TamuroBio is to develop TB-019 as a novel therapeutic for the treatment of NASH
and to mitigate the progression of fibrosis."

With over 12,000 MRI
scanners in the U.S. and estimates that $434,000 are lost per scanner each year, motion in MRIs is costing our
health care system approximately $4B yearly. Our FDA-cleared software solution Framewise Integrated Real-
Time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM) mitigates data lost due to motion. However, the majority of paying customers so
far are academic neuroimaging research centers; in order to ensure the commercial success of FIRMM, we
need to expand the customer base to clinical institutions. The goal of this CRP application is to fill gaps in
FIRMM clinical commercialization sales by partnering with Siemens and building functionality to streamline
clinical use of FIRMM and FIRMM-pix.Leading hospitals have expressed enthusiasm to use FIRMM for clinical care; however, two main
barriers to clinical adoption remain: a reduction in technician critical decision making and a seamless
integration into existing clinical workflows. Both of these barriers can be overcome via Siemens’ Access-I,
which provides an FDA approved licensing and authentication scheme to enable secure and direct operation of
Siemens systems from any 3rd party vendor device. Pairing the FIRMM tablet with Siemens' Access-I module
will allow for the FIRMM tablet to re-start a scan automatically when the quality is low via a direct interaction
with the clinical scanner, thus saving time, easing workflows, and standardizing decision making for
technicians. Integrating the FIRMM tablet with Siemens' Access-I will lead to a more seamless integration into
existing workflows; thus reducing the disruption to existing complex clinical workflows.In addition, integrating the FIRMM tablet with Siemens' Access-I module will facilitate the wide-spread
adoption of FIRMM(-pix) in the clinical market by obtaining widespread visibility via co-marketing with Siemens
Healthineers and their catalog. Importantly, this partnership with Siemens is planned only as an initial step to
establishing clinical commercialization sales. Although Siemens is the leading MRI manufacturer, GE and
Philips combine with Siemens to account for almost 90% of the MRI market. The proposed activities in this
CRP will form the basis of future work to establish similar partnerships with GE and Philips. Overall, this CRP
is perfectly positioned to put FIRMM and its subsequent products on a pathway to long-term success."

This Phase IIB SBIR grant application proposes to continue development and commercialization of OsteoDx’s
Cortical Bone Mechanics Technology™ (CBMT™), a novel osteoporosis related diagnostic device that non-
invasively measures the mechanical properties of cortical bone and provides direct information about bone
strength and quality that is not accessible by other diagnostic modalities. OsteoDx has already successfully
illustrated commercial feasibility and demonstrated that CBMT can accurately and efficiently estimate ulna bone
bending strength (R2=0.99). OsteoDx also established that CBMT is sensitive to detecting change in bone
strength and provides information about cortical bone that is unique and independent of Bone Mineral Density
(BMD), which suggests CBMT may yield clinically significant information about osteoporotic fracture potential.
Osteoporosis is a common medical condition causing progressive weakening of bones, eventually leading to
nontraumatic or fragility fractures. These fractures are painful and, in many cases, cause prolonged or life-long
disability, and dramatically increases mortality rates up to 8x within 3 months post fracture. The Bone Health and
Osteoporosis Foundation projects that by 2025, there will be 3 million osteoporosis related fractures every year
in the US, resulting in healthcare costs of more than $57 billion. Numerous treatments with varying mechanisms
of action exist for osteoporosis and, if given to high-risk individuals, could dramatically reduce the risk of fracture.
However, current osteoporosis treatment decisions are heavily driven by X-ray based measurements of BMD
and risk surveys. Unfortunately, these tools lack sufficient discriminatory sensitivity and accuracy to identify many
individuals at high risk of experiencing a fragility fracture. For instance, lt50% of the variation in whole-bone
strength is attributable to variations in BMD, and the vast majority of patients who sustain fragility fractures do
not have low BMD (i.e., they have T-score’s above −2.5). Thus, there is a large unmet need to better diagnose
patients who are at risk of fracture, so that physicians can accurately identify individuals who would benefit from
osteoporosis medications and to better monitor the effectiveness of treatment. OsteoDx’s market research,
interviews with key opinion leaders, and prior meetings with the FDA have identified the most important and
immediate commercialization milestones necessary for FDA approval and market adoption: a study that
demonstrates the accuracy (aim 1) and clinical precision (aim 2) of the final design production version of the
medical device, and advances safety and regulatory compliance (aim 3). Thus, in this Phase II application we
propose a series of experiments, tests, and approaches to accomplish the above-mentioned aims. Upon
successful achievement of these aims, OsteoDx will be positioned to submit a Class II de novo medical device
application to the FDA for noninvasively quantifying flexural rigidity of cortical bone in the ulna. To achieve the
aims of this proposal and the other commercialization objectives of OsteoDx, the company has assembled a
highly seasoned team with broad experience and expertise."

Each year, approximately one-third of all hospitalized patients in the US (corresponding to about 12 million
Americans) receive unfractionated heparin (UFH) to prevent clotting during surgical and invasive medical
procedures, such as open-heart surgery and transcatheter heart valve replacement, and to prevent postoperative
clotting issues, such as deep vein thrombosis, and major ischemic events, such as pulmonary embolism, heart
attack, and stroke. UFH is a fast-acting, reversible, and inexpensive anticoagulant drug that indirectly inhibits
several clotting factors, including thrombin and Xa. However, UFH is associated with serious acute side effects,
including hypersensitivity reactions. The non-linear dose response to UFH and a high degree of patient-to-patient
and batch-to-batch variability lead to medication errors related to improper dosing, and these errors are among
the most common and serious in clinical practice. An estimated 1-5% of patients who receive UFH experience
an immune response known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is considered life threatening or
results in death in 20-30% of affected patients. Additionally, up to 26% of cardiac surgery patients experience
“heparin resistance,” where achieving therapeutic anticoagulation requires excessive doses of UFH. As with any
anticoagulant, treatment with UFH carries the risk of excessive bleeding, which can be fatal. UFH is reversed by
protamine, which is also associated with serious side effects, including anaphylaxis and toxicity. Accurate
determination of the dosing ratio of protamine to UFH is challenging, putting patients at risk for protamine
overdose. In the context of medical procedures that require precise (i.e., immediate and titratable) hemostatic
control, such as transcatheter heart valve replacement, these shortcomings are particularly challenging. Thus,
there is a recognized, unmet medical need for new anticoagulant/reversal agent combinations that are safe and
fast acting with a predictable dose response to enable more precise hemostatic control during medical
procedures. Helixomer, Inc. is developing a novel polynucleotide-based anticoagulant/antidote combination for
intravenous anticoagulation. In vitro and in vivo data have demonstrated that Helixomer’s anticoagulant drug,
Hex01, and its antidote, Hex02, are highly specific and fast acting, with clear, predictable dose responses. Hex01
specifically binds to and directly inhibits thrombin, the enzyme responsible for fibrin deposition and clot formation.
Hex02 base-pairs with and deactivates Hex01, reversing the anticoagulant effect by releasing thrombin. In this
Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project, Helixomer will advance the preclinical development of Hex01 and Hex02 by i)
validating bioanalytical assays for Hex01 and Hex02 in plasma to support preclinical development, ii) establishing
scale-up manufacturing methods for Hex01, iii) determining a dosing strategy for Hex01 and Hex02 in a porcine
large-animal model, and iv) defining safety and toxicity profiles for Hex01 and Hex02 and identifying the
maximum tolerated dose through non-GLP dose range finding studies in rats and dogs. Successful completion
of these critical preclinical studies will support subsequent pivotal GLP toxicology studies and IND submission."

The goal of PuraCath’s Commercial Readiness Pilot is to prepare for commercialization
of a therapeutic system for disinfection of a needleless connector for Peripherally Inserted
Central Catheters that reduces the risk of intraluminal colonization as a source of
catheter-related bloodstream infections. The system uses ultraviolet light to eliminate
microbes and biofilm derived from fungi and bacteria by 99.99%, a 4-log reduction, to
prevent Catheter Line Associated Bloodstream Infections. We propose to develop a
commercialization-ready Firefly™ UV Disinfection System. This system consists of a
neutral displacement, straight valve, UV-transmissive, needleless connector; and a
handheld device with UV LEDs and sensor technology.
In Phase II, PuraCath Medical developed and validated the Firefly™ UV Disinfection
System performance. The FDA 510(k) submission process was initiated, and an initial
clearance was received for the Firefly Needleless Connector (K203796, cleared July 30,
2021). The Firefly UV Disinfection Handpiece and Charging Station are currently under
review with the FDA with clearance for the initial design pending (K213160, application
filed November 12, 2021).
In this Commercial Readiness Pilot, we will complete the steps needed to support clinical
use and commercialization, with four aims: 1) Establish readiness for commercial
manufacturing, 2) Prepare for clinical trials, 3) Develop a Quality System, integrate
manufacturing partners, and design and prepare training materials and; 4) Develop
software to monitor and ensure proper use and compliance.
These results will enable us to conduct clinical studies that will support our efficacy claims
and provide evidence of the benefit of the system. In parallel, we are seeking Phase IIb
support to conduct the clinical trials. The outcome of this entire SBIR program will be a
body of clinical evidence to drive adoption of the Firefly™ UV Disinfection System by
hospitals. The proposed project will improve scientific knowledge in the UV disinfection
space for colonized surfaces and clinical practices for infection control in hospitals and
outpatient clinics. Additionally, with the help of this NIH CRP grant we will generate data
supporting other UV LED applications for disinfection in hospital settings."

Patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) experience low oxygen saturation, shortness of breath, low quality
of life, and a short life span (lt10 years) following diagnosis. These patients frequently present to emergency
rooms, and many are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), straining the health care system. Despite therapy
with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, prostacyclin analogs, and endothelin antagonists, mortality remains high
and quality of life poor. With no specific drug available for curative treatment, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), a
pulmonary artery-specific vasodilator, is the best option for treating PH without compromising systemic blood
pressure. Current tank-based iNO delivery systems are expensive and available only in operating rooms and
ICUs of established medical centers in developed countries. The need is great for simpler, portable, and less
expensive iNO technologies. During phase 1, a proof-of-concept prototype was developed in partnership with
the University of Alabama at Birmingham. All the proposed goals in phase 1 were met and the technology was
further advanced through several innovations. First, the NO generation method was modified from the original
proposal of producing sustained release NO from its precursor molecule to producing a stock bulk amount in a
single-step chemical reaction to synthesize medical grade NO in a sealed container on demand. This method
will avoid the pitfalls of current NO generation approaches pursued by other companies in which nitrogen dioxide
(NO2, a toxic gas) is converted to NO, or atmospheric air is oxidized to NO by high voltage electric sparks with
subsequent need for extensive purification steps. Second, it is proposed to mix this 100% NO directly with
supplemental oxygen to attain therapeutic doses while reducing co-delivery of NO2 to levels far below FDA safety
limits or diluting NO in inert nitrogen (N2) gas within the device prior to mixing with supplemental oxygen. These
systems avoid the need to dilute NO 1250-fold in N2 gas for storage in compressed cylinders and transport to
hospitals, as is done with current systems. Third, an integrated gas sensor system for NO and NO2 measurement
and electronic control systems for dispensing NO was developed. The assembled prototype is functioning well
and as expected. Based on these encouraging results, iNOvodel, Inc. was formed to license, develop and
commercialize a full-scale product. In Aim 1, focus is centered on developing a fully functional hospital-based
and demonstrating feasibility for a portable iNO devices incorporating an optimized reusable NO-generating
cartridge. Aim 2 seeks to establish the chemical method for generating and storing NO in the cartridge to utilize
on-demand. Aim 3 is directed toward development of noninvasive and invasive interface systems that are
compatible with iNO devices for safe delivery of nitric oxide to patients. Further, the safety of the device to deliver
NO using an in vitro benchtop NO delivery system that simulates the patient NO delivery system will be evaluated
facilitating the pursuit of FDA regulatory approval."

Nytricx is developing a new class of Nitric Oxide (NO)-releasing intravascular medical catheters to combat
infection and thrombosis associated with indwelling vascular catheters. NO gas is a natural anti-infective and
anti-thrombotic human product principally released from blood vessels and immune cells. Nytricx NO-releasing
technology to the catheter surfaces via a polymer matrix, mimics the natural release by cells to prevent infection
and thrombosis. The Nytricx technology is designed to combine anti-infective and anti-thrombotic properties of
Nitric Oxide (NO) release at the internal and external catheter interfaces, which may be an extremely effective
means to prolong catheter life, decrease chronic infection, and blood clotting (thrombosis) associated with
intravascular catheters. The combination of a novel topcoats with NO gas release from the base silicone polymer
is unique, especially considering that the NO donor itself stays embedded in the polymer with only the NO gas
escaping to affect the external and internal catheter environments. The topcoat also affects biofilm formation
which is also a chronic problem associated with catheter infections preventing effective antibiotic therapy. Nytricx
NO-releasing technology represents a disruptive innovation that will result in saving patients’ lives and cutting
medical costs, especially those related to hospital acquired blood steam infections and thrombosis, associated
with intravascular catheters."

Neonatal seizures occur in over 14,000 newborns annually in the US, and are frequently
associated with long-term deleterious consequences including intellectual disability, epilepsy,
and other neurodevelopmental disabilities. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the only reliable
means of detecting seizures; however, many Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) do not
have the capability to do EEG recordings due to the lack of skilled EEG technicians to apply gel-
based electrodes to delicate neonatal skin and acquire clean signals.
Under NIH SBIR funding, Quantum Applied Science and Research (QUASAR), a leader in
noninvasive sensor technology, in collaboration with Children’s National Hospital (CNH), a top
ranked pediatric hospital, has been developing a Neonatal EEG MOnitor (“NEMO”) device
intended as a reliable and easy-to-use EEG system that will increase availability of neonatal
EEG monitoring to hospitals that typically lack this capability. The NEMO device takes
advantage of QUASAR’s innovative dry sensing technology combined with a soft cap that is
designed for minimal impact on the infants’ wellbeing and ease of use in the hospital
environment. NEMO will lead to more neonates being screened and treated, and thus to shorter
hospital stays and improved outcomes.
Under Phase I and Phase II of this project, QUASAR and CNH have validated QUASAR’s dry
electrodes for the neonatal monitoring application in a NICU environment, demonstrating their
signal quality was comparable to that of wet electrodes, and built a prototype NEMO headset.
The main goal of the proposed Phase IIb effort is to finalize the NEMO device, validate its
performance on neonates in the NICU environment, and obtain 510(k) clearance for it. In order
to accomplish this goal, QUASAR will work with ProPharma, a regulatory consultant firm, to
establish current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and finalize the NEMO device under
cGMP. QUASAR will then complete Safety Testing, and in collaboration with CNH will conduct
a Clinical Validation to obtain the necessary data for a 510(k) submission. The final step in the
project will be a product launch in partnership with medical device manufacturers and
distributors."

These types of injuries increase the chances of developing infections while waiting for transfer and after admission to medical care facilities. Treating infections due to combat-related wounds requires a high level of medical resources and is less successful compared to civilian wounds, often leading to extended hospital stays and substantial morbidity and mortality. The current practice is to provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment before identification of the pathogen or antimicrobial susceptibility profile, which may also lead to antimicrobial resistance. The majority of these infections have been identified as bacterial, though combat-related fungal wound infections have been found to be an important cause of loss of limb, morbidity, and mortality for military personnel that face traumatic wounds, generally due to blast injuries. Nanobiofab proposes a Real-time Agnostic Patch for Infection Detection (RAPID) device, which utilizes a patented nanosensor array and artificial intelligence algorithms that is telemedicine capable for real-time and rapid detection and following of wound infections and pathogen identification suitable for both the field environment and hospital setting alike. Nanobiofab has developed the RAPID-iNose wearable device, which integrates a wireless high-sensitive nanosensor array and AI algorithms for in situ, continuous sensing of complex microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) released by pathogens. The device can identify and differentiate wound pathogens (Gram+ or Gram– bacteria and tentatively fungi) and provide continuous noninvasive diagnostic capability at any site of injury, enabling the monitoring of infections in real-time for suitable treatment. The RAPID-iNose is small, lightweight, and integrates into wound dressing systems, hypothermia bags, or transport chambers with wirelessly tracking and monitoring of infection development and progression to optimize resources. Data can be shared with medical professionals in real-time to realize more accurate and appropriate treatment. This device will enable the detection of infections in the early stages, allow clinicians to identify pathogens quickly and easily, and reduce treatment costs. In SBIR Phase II, Nanobiofab will refine the alpha version prototype, validate its performance and specifications for pathogen detection in vitro and in vivo, and develop a commercialization plan. These milestones will build upon the successful completion of SBIR Phase I, which resulted in the development of a functional prototype validated on the pig skin tissue model."

Optical manufacturing has been a rapidly growing field with advancements in all technology spectrums. High performance optical systems are needed in aerospace, defense, medical, and commercial components. Industry is requiring these components to be manufactured to tighter tolerances and lower costs. Many advancements have been made in cost reduction and increasing quality in axis-symmetric optics such as flats, spheres, aspheres, and off axis parabolas. Some of the advancements on axis-symmetric parts have been applied to freeform and conformal manufacturing, but, due to the drastic geometric differences, they do not have the same impact in time reduction. Along with the geometric challenges, the materials used for MDA applications are made from hard-to-machine ceramics in order to withstand harsh environments and still provide high quality optical transmission. The harder ceramics require unique methods to remove the proper amount of sub surface damage to meet roughness tolerances. The purpose of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to improve the existing freeform polishing processing methods by 2x to 3x on crystals and hard ceramics. Extensive research has been done to get the current process in a stable condition to consistently produce optical freeform components. This research work was done in prototype phases that have addressed areas that need improvement to reach the optical tolerances, with a focus on quality over production times. New technologies have been created for metrology and machining that specifically address conformal ceramic window challenges. The goal is to move the optical freeform process from small quantity high cost protypes to larger yields and lower cost production. Leveraging the knowledge from research and existing freeform manufacturing processes, new advancements will be made to reach the proposed goal. Five keys areas have been identified to reach the set goal: intelligent machining, fixture improvements, improvements for OptiPro’s OptiSonic technology for ultrasonic grinding, development of deterministic edge polishing, and increased software capabilities in OptiPro’s freeform manufacturing software PROSurf. Improvements in each of these topics will drastically decrease the overall polishing time in conformal window manufacturing. These advancements will have a positive impact on many areas of optical manufacturing as the technology being developed will work on all optical system components to reduce grinding and polishing process times.

In the tactical combat casualty care (TCCC) environment, ETI encompasses the majority of combat prehospital airway securement. Unfortunately, ETI is one of the most common incorrectly performed life-saving interventions in this setting, with failure rates as high as 18% by paramedics, and much higher rates of failed first-pass success. Error rates in the civilian sector are similar, where prehospital paramedic first-pass success ranges between 46% – 77%. One review noted that almost one in four patients receiving prehospital ETI were exposed to an error. Struggling with ETI leads to higher morbidity and increased downstream patient illness. Although operator skill, patient issues, and environmental factors all contribute to ETI challenges, there also exists a large technology gap that prevents patients from accessing safe and certain ETI in all circumstances and conditions. This is especially the case for less experienced operators whose incumbent responsibilities include this life-saving procedure. In the context of TCCC, this gap will be exacerbated within the long-distance en-route care or prolonged field care scenarios anticipated in the multi-domain operations environment. In these scenarios smaller, dispersed mobility forces will be more likely to perform definitive airway management (ETI) on casualties due to constraints imposed by prolonged evacuation and transit times. Highly experienced operators may not be immediately available, and limited resources will exacerbate strains associated with ETI-related complications. Operator visualization of the vocal cords has historically been the most difficult step for operators while performing ETI. However, despite the introduction of video-assisted laryngoscopy into practice almost 20 years ago, which arguably provides enhanced visualization, gaps remain in ETI success. This is because VL, while making visualization easier, has made the subsequent steps of insertion of the endotracheal tube (ETT) through the vocal cords and cannulation of the ETT into the trachea more difficult, resulting in a statistical inversion of the historical pain points. During our Phase I effort we demonstrated the technical feasibility of developing and manufacturing our bougie-integrated stylet technology. Our technology is founded upon a modern understanding of the anatomic and skill issues that inhibit rapid ETI success, particularly during video laryngoscopy. Our device uses a novel integrated bougie, which can be directed down the trachea via a memory wire, thus enabling easier vocal cords insertion and an unimpeded pathway for the ETT. Our aim is to finalize our technology which also aims to complement traditional direct laryngoscopy (DL) ETI, thus enhancing all current ETI enabling technologies."

To address these limitations, innovative medical technologies that provide continuous assessment of the physiological status of injured military servicemen are in high demand. Specifically, the ability for real-time, vital sign monitoring and reporting supported by machine learning predictive algorithms will be essential for near instantaneous medical status alerting in mass casualty scenarios requiring Prolonged Field Care (24-72 hours) before medical evacuation can occur. Accurate, real-time vital signs parameters are conventionally achieved via external probes, which are physically and logistically obtrusive and can become partially or fully-detached, especially in field care.. Presently, there are no technologies that routinely provide autonomous, real-time vital sign measurement from within the body either through implantation or ingestion. To address these challenges, Nanohmics Inc., working in collaboration with Professor Nanshu Lu of the University of Texas at Austin, Mr. Ulf Borg (Director of Clinical Science of the Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies Group), Dr. Eric Snider (Biomedical Engineer at the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (San Antonio, TX)), and Capstan Technologies, a compact microfluidics and biocompatibility mechanical engineer firm, proposes to continue advanced development of its compact, nano-sensing-enabled microrobotic ingestible capsule platform (VitalScopeTM) that provides in situ measurement of vital signs. The VitalScope capsule technology will be the first ingestible capsule capable of ECG and arterial pressure waveform monitoring that enables determination of real-time heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. Direct arterial pressure monitoring continues to be one of the most important techniques in managing critical patients in the hospital, because it is a direct representation of the patient’s cardiac cycle and hemodynamic status. The major barrier to transitioning this powerful monitoring method to the field is the conventionally invasive nature of the method. Nanohmics’ integration of arterial pressure waveform monitoring into a non-invasive swallowable capsule will provide a major break-through in the monitoring of patients in the battlefield, and in civilian environments. Data will be transmitted in real-time via secure wireless protocol, with Machine Learning/AI algorithms to assist clinical decision making. Patient status such as shock and other critical states can be recognized by autocorrelation of the relevant vital signs in the AI software. The Machine Learning algorithm can be trained to recognize when a patient is beginning to deteriorate, before a full-fledged manifestation of critical signs is apparent, in order to alert timely intervention and treatment."

About 20% of all battlefield deaths are potentially survivable. Of these, most service members (84%) suffered hemorrhage and potentially could have been saved.  Resuscitation in the field is often seriously inadequate even in patients transported to local field hospitals for full resuscitation. Delays in evacuation in far-forward units may be hours to days. Time becomes critical. There remains a need for a more effective resuscitation medium for patients with severe hemorrhagic shock, especially in pre-hospital settings. For these lives to be saved better techniques and tools are required, first to address the loss of circulating blood and second to address the problems of reversible cellular and circulatory damage that unresuscitated shock can produce. It is the issue of secondary cellular and circulatory damage arising from shock that this proposal addresses. In a state of shock, the resultant energy deficit compromises the sodium pump resulting in sodium and water entering the cell causing swelling.  Tissue swelling after a period of shock significantly reduces the number of open capillaries and without specific intervention, may prevent the re-establishment of normal perfusion and the restoration of the cellular energy deficit even after the restoration of normal intravascular volume. Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and Perfusion Medical have addressed this with a strategy preventing metabolic cell swelling that occurs during tissue and cell ischemia by using cell impermeants. Using this approach over the last 15 years, the (VCU) laboratory has developed a next-generation LVR solution that, in pre-clinical models, is highly efficacious, stable, and outwardly safe. The USAMRDC has made a major investment funding the laboratory development of this solution at VCU.  This product, which we refer to hereafter as PM-208, can be used in conjunction with blood products, or given independently of blood, but is not a substitute for blood or plasma. PM-208 component increases tolerance to a low volume state seventeen-fold greater than an equivalent volume of LR, Hextend, or even fresh whole autologous blood in a highly robust swine hemorrhagic shock survival model. Survival to 24 hours increases from 0% in the LR or whole blood volume controls to 100% with PM-208 alone. Maximum survival tested to date is 7 days so far with PM-208. Perfusion Medical was established to bring PM-208 to market. The company has raised more than $1 million, completed the pre-IND process with the FDA and begun manufacturing in a GMP environment. The funding requested in this proposal will allow the company to achieve a key regulatory milestone, IND filing, and advance development of a version of the drug designed for military field use."

The proposed enhancements utilize the lasted augmented reality technology to overlay realistic animations with bleeding effects on top of physical task trainers as well as on virtual models in software tools to increase fidelity in simulation and effectiveness in training.  One of the challenges in using AR devices such as iPad or HoloLens for surgical procedure training is that a user has to use his/her hands for clicking through the software and holding medical instrument to perform the procedure on task trainers.

The proposed enhancement leverages the latest artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) technology to help the user to navigate through a procedure with voice commands while keeping the hands free for performing the procedure on a task trainer.  In addition to voice navigation, AR headset such as Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 for commercial applications and IVAS (Integrated Visual Augmentation System) for military applications frees the user’s hands completely in conjunction with voice commands. The proposed enhancement to migrate all three procedures to HoloLens 2 which will accommodate both military applications when IVAS devices are available and commercial applications now. The proposed enhancements will be developed for fasciotomy, cricothyroidotomy and lateral canthotomy tools on iOS, Android, and HoloLens hardware platforms, which would accommodate both government and commercial user groups. The technology developed for the proposed effort can be easily used for developing training tools for other procedures commonly performed in private sectors such as hospitals, medical schools, and medical training facilities."

This commercialization readiness pilot (CRP) by care.coach corporation (Millbrae, CA) requests funds for late-
stage research and development and technical assistance for a conversational technology driven by artificial
intelligence (AI) that was developed with and for older adults, especially those aging with Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (ADRD). Past work has resulted in a socially assistive robot (SAR) and virtual health
assistant overseen by humans that improves health outcomes and reduces loneliness in older adults at a lower
cost of care. Customer loyalty is world-class and far exceeds net promotor scores (NPS) for well-known
conversational agents, attesting to the product’s commercial potential. Moreover, active Phase II funding
(5R44AG0620-14-03) has resulted in an automated speech recognition (ASR) engine that is more accurate in
understanding truly natural speech by older adults, including those with ADRD, than major conversional AI
platforms. This is significant given the inherent challenges that the speech of older adults, especially of those
with ADRD, poses to conversational AI due to normal age-related neurological changes or brain pathology
associated with ADRD.
Leveraging these advances and innovations, care.coach is preparing for rapid growth and has attracted
considerable interest from insurers, corporate development arms of large insurers, and traditional investors.
To successfully scale, we propose to re-platform our current system on top of an enterprise-grade, integrated
knowledge solution enabled by KIE, an opensource platform powered by KIE’s Drools/jBPM rules and process
engines. The KIE platform has revolutionized enterprise operations, and has been adopted in healthcare to
drive quality and efficiency with applications ranging from the adjudication of health insurance claims to the
implementation of clinical decision support systems. In addition to business process automation, the cost of
goods sold (COGS) will come down with full conversational automation in allowable use cases by training and
using a large language model. Both capabilities will be developed in the proposed CRP using state-of-the-art
technical approaches, and will be evaluated for performance and acceptance in a replication study with ADRD
patients in partnership with a health plan and medical providers that serve a large, diverse elderly population.
This technical assistance and late-stage development will deliver a state-of-the-art, consumer-facing conversa-
tional agent and virtual health assistant driven by a technology platform with industrial production and automa-
tion methods that ensure consistent and scalable digital health service delivery and manufacturing, and that
meet the highest security and consumer satisfaction standards. The overall goal is to improve the health and

This project is the development of a non-invasively extending distal femur replacement
(DFR) for children and adolescents subsequent to bone tumor resection. Each year in
the US there are 200-250 malignant bone tumor diagnoses in the distal femurs of
patients 15 years and younger. With advances in chemotherapy, limb salvage surgery
utilizing a megaprosthesis has increasingly become the treatment of choice. For
growing patients these megaprostheses are required to extend so they can “grow” as
the contralateral limb grows. Only one non-invasively lengthened DFR is FDA approved
to treat these patients. The implant is actuated with a large electromagnetic appliance in
a clinical setting. It is exceedingly complex and the average revision rate has been
reported at 48%, including revisions for: insufficient lengthening capacity, lengthening
mechanism failure, implant fracture, aseptic loosening and infection. MRI is
contraindicated and the implant is extremely expensive. Our device is non-invasively,
manually extended by pressing on the patient's skin. It's designed for a significantly
reduced complication rate, the mechanism is simple and robust, it's MRI compatible and
can be lengthened at home for a more gradual growth and constant leg length equality.
It is capable of up to 240% of the extension that its sole US competitor offers and is
easier and less expensive to manufacture so it can be offered at a reduced price to a
greater population. The specific aims of the project are to (1) complete the implant
design, (2) design specialized surgical instruments for implantation and (3) conduct non-
clinical bench testing in preparation for FDA submission."

Oral cancer (OC) is an underserved disease, which is often overlooked by the medical community. Yet it is the 6th mostcommon and deadliest cancer in the world. According to the Oral Cancer Foundation, over 90% of all oral cancers are oralsquamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) - a common subset of head and neck cancers. OC claims the life of one American everyhour of each day. Additionally, it is on the rise due to the increasing prevalence of oral human papilloma virus (HPV).Overall, OC has a 60% survival rate after 5-year remission target, with recurrence being an important prognostic factor.Data shows a high correlation between OC risks and low socioeconomic, as well as risk factors related to lifestyle. Even inthe clinical settings of industrialized nations, such as the United States (US), many patients receive suboptimal care forOSCC due to limited resources. Although targeted agents (i.e., tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and immunotherapy (i.e.,checkpoint inhibitors) have shown promise in multiple solid tumor types, their applicability in the setting of advanced OSCCremains questionable. Unpredictable side effects, complications, and (especially) high cost limit their US use in low resourcesettings and in low/mid-income countries (LMICs). Survival in patients with advanced OSCC is driven primarily bylocoregional treatment failure/recurrence (i.e., primary site or cervical nodal basins). Escalation of conventional treatmentregimens, such as surgery, radiation, and systemic chemotherapy is not feasible due to dose-limiting toxicities. As a resultof these converging factors, there is a need for novel treatments that can augment existing modalities, while improvinglocoregional control without toxicities. To address this need, Privo has developed the PRV211 intraoperative product
(PRV211), a nano-engineered hydrogel that, immediately after tumor resection or debulking, can be applied directly ontothe tumor bed. PRV211, retains high concentration of immuno/chemotherapy nanoparticles, locally in tumor bed andregional lymph nodes to treat the locoregional disease and reduce tumor recurrence."

The overarching goal of this project is to protect the nation’s supply chain of critical medical
devices that are sterilized using ethylene oxide (EtO). Despite the search for alternative
approaches, a large fraction of single-use devices is sterilized with EtO. These devices, including
catheters, heart valves, and tracheostomy tubes, are critical to routine and life-saving procedures
and therapies. As regulations for EtO emissions become more stringent to protect workers and
communities from harmful exposure, there is a significant risk that supply chains for critical
devices will be disrupted, in turn threatening the health and well-being of the nation. The specific
objectives of this project include the development of a novel photocatalytic system to mitigate EtO
at levels that are hazardous but difficult to address with existing adsorptive and thermal catalytic
approaches. Specifically, the technology addresses concentrations in the range of 5 ppm and
below in sterilization facilities, transportation, and warehouses. These “fugitive emissions” are a
significant contributor to overall emissions and directly impact workers and community safety.
Objectives include determining operating conditions at which low concentrations of EtO (lt5 ppm)
are oxidized at 99% destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) by identifying the optimum
photocatalyst and parameter space for achieving high DRE. The specific aims are: Aim 1)
optimize a 100 CFM photoreactor fluid flow, optical power, and catalyst parameters for 99% EtO
DRE at fugitive EtO concentrations, Aim 2) develop a 100 CFM system based on the photoreactor
from Aim 1 that can address EtO emissions in a real-world environment, Aim 3) evaluate
performance of the Aim 2 100 CFM system in a sterilization facility, and Aim 4) analyze the Aim
2 system operational lifetime factors. Various computational fluid dynamics and non-sequential
optical models will be leveraged by the experimental efforts. Standard and cutting-edge detection
approaches that are capable of measuring EtO into the low ppb and ppt ranges will be used in the
experimental program."

The goal of this project is to develop and validate a novel therapeutic lead compound for the treatment of
psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Chemokines orchestrate the migration of inflammatory cells during normal immune
responses and are required for immune tissue development and homeostasis. When aberrant chemokine
function occurs, improper recruitment of immune cells can lead to a variety of inflammatory pathologies with
devastating effects on a patient’s quality of life. The chemokine CCL20 and its G protein-coupled receptor
CCR6 drive the development of psoriatic disease through the initiation and continuous recruitment of
inflammatory Th17-expressing cells into skin and connective tissue. Our published biochemical, cell-based and
in vivo studies prove that an engineered recombinant protein that mimics the dimeric version of the natural
CCL20 molecule completely reverses its normal pro-inflammatory functional profile. In a Phase I SBIR project,
the lead compound (CCL20LD) reduced the signs of established psoriatic dermatitis (PsD) in a preclinical
mouse model that faithfully recapitulates human psoriasis. Unexpectedly, CCL20LD treatment also alleviated
joint and tendon inflammation, demonstrating efficacy in a clinically relevant model of human psoriatic
arthritis. The same project also yielded a favorable preliminary safety profile with no indication of liver or
kidney toxicity and a validated manufacturing and quality control protocol. There is a significant need for new
treatments for psoriatic arthritis because current options carry the risk of immunosuppression and loss of
efficacy over time. This Direct-to-Phase II proposal builds on the completed Phase I milestones to complete
preclinical testing and optimization of CCL20LD and assemble the necessary efficacy, safety, and
manufacturing data for an IND application and clinical trials for psoriatic arthritis. XLock Biosciences, LLC (XL)
will manufacture the CCL20LD protein and direct the studies proposed in three specific aims. In Aim 1, XLock
will improve the in vivo stability of the first generation CCL20LD molecule with modifications known to extend
the circulating half-life of biologic drugs. In Aim 2 XL and its academic collaborators at UC Davis will establish
the therapeutic dose and schedule which produces the strongest anti-psoriatic effect in joint tissues in the
shortest time period. Lastly, in Aim 3, XL’s collaborators at the Medical College of Wisconsin will measure
CCL20LD’s immunomodulatory activity and its effect on rodent susceptibility to commensal fungal infection.
Altering CCR6 signaling through the engineering of its native ligand is an innovative paradigm shift in clinical
approaches for treating auto-inflammatory diseases. Development of engineered CCL20 variants as biological
therapeutics will have significant positive impact for psoriatic arthritis patients by reducing side effects and
providing a drug with extended therapeutic lifetimes. Moreover, the resultant method has the potential for
treating other Th17–mediated diseases."

Deep learning has transformed medical image analysis by delivering clinically meaningful results on challenging
problems like prostate cancer detection and lung cancer screening. FDA approval of whole-slide digital pathology
imaging (WSIs) for primary diagnosis is further increasing interest, adoption, and investment in artificial intelli-
gence (AI) technology for pathology. Learning from large medical images using patient-level labels (PLLs) has
become an active computational pathology research area. PLLs such as pathology diagnosis or clinical outcomes
are generated through healthcare operations and are often readily available. In contrast to learning paradigms
that depend on the expert annotation of images (e.g., delineating tumor regions) and are therefore time-intensive
and limited to smaller cohorts, training directly from WSIs using PLLs will allow the development of realistic
training datasets containing tens-of-thousands of subjects that can produce models with clinically-meaningful ac-
curacy. GPU accelerators have played a significant role in advancing deep learning methods for computational
pathology tools. Machine Learning Frameworks (MLFs), e.g., Pytorch and TensorFlow, provide researchers with
abstractions to quickly develop models that utilize GPUs. The evolution of GPUs and MLFs has been driven by
the analysis of small images, and so applying these tools directly to WSIs or other large medical images like
volumetric magnetic resonance or computed tomography is challenging. Adapting medical imaging problems to
the small image paradigm leads to many compromises resulting in suboptimal performance, increased imple-
mentation effort, and increased software/design complexity (e.g., patch based techniques or multiple instance
learning). As a result, the development of scalable ML models from PLLs by directly processing WSI images
through a deep learning pipeline is infeasible today on GPUs. Recent efforts that use unified GPU memory or
streaming approaches to overcome GPU memory limits and attempt to perform end-to-end training at WSI scale
have demonstrated superior performance to annotation or MIL. However, these approaches are either slow (due
to suboptimal data movement strategies), complex to adapt/use, or highly specific to a given network architecture
(limiting the ability to develop and explore new architectures). More general-purpose, efficient, and user-friendly
frameworks are needed to allow the development of WSI scale deep learning.This project will develop a robust software framework to facilitate seamless development and use of scalable
ML models, without the imposition of any limits on the sizes of handled images, unhindered by the limited memory
capacity in GPUs. The proposed SSTEP (Seamless Scalable Tensor-Expression Execution via Partitioning) soft-
ware framework will allow scalable and portable neural network models that directly process full high-resolution
images of arbitrary size for training or inference, on any (multi) GPU platform. SSTEP will allow the development
of novel deep learning paradigms that are purpose-built for medical applications, and will enable developers to
rapidly create and evaluate these tools using familiar MLFs - PyTorch or TensorFlow."

The COVID-19 pandemic intersecting with the opioid epidemic led to dramatic shifts in the delivery of care for
opioid use disorders (OUD). Historically, methadone has been provided as directly-observed therapy (DOT) at
opioid treatment programs (OTPs). This model of care delivery has been a barrier to accessing care due to
imposed travel burden and disruption to work and family responsibilities for clients. To minimize infectious
risks, on March 16, 2020 the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration issued a blanket
exception to OTPs allowing for 28 day supplies of take-home medications for all “stable” clients, and up to
14-day supplies for clients who are “less stable”. These changes created an opportunity to innovate
methadone care delivery models to allow more flexibility and client-centeredness by requiring fewer in-person
visits. Yet, less frequent DOT could lead to increased risk for diversion and medication toxicity. An ideal model
would optimize both flexibility and safety. Our prior Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of an
innovative mobile health platform to provide asynchronous, video DOT and to screen for symptoms of
COVID-19 for patients treated for OUD with methadone. We propose to extend our prior research by scaling
the intervention (video-DOT) across a large, multisite OTP organization via a Hybrid Type 2
Effectiveness-Implementation study with stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design in which we will
simultaneously test implementation and clinical outcomes. Our Aim 1: Conduct a stepped wedge randomized
trial to evaluate the impact of asynchronous video-DOT on verification of methadone dosing, increased
take-homes, and other treatment outcomes. Three clinics within a single, large OTP organization will be
randomly assigned to calendar time for implementation of video-DOT. Clinical outcomes will be assessed
pragmatically via electronic health records (pre- and post-implementation) and via the smartphone application
to examine if implementation of video-DOT is associated with primary outcomes of (1) increases in the
proportion of methadone doses that are observed (remote or in-person) and (2) increased take-homes, and
secondary outcomes of (3) reduced in-person OTP visits, (4) increased medication coverage, and (5)
increased 90-day treatment retention. Our Aim 2: Conduct a formative evaluation to: a) understand barriers
and facilitators to implementation of video-DOT at each clinic, b) understand perspectives on and
acceptability/feasibility of video-DOT among key stakeholders, and c) develop best practices to support optimal
scalability of video-DOT. We will conduct qualitative interviews with medical providers, counselors, dispensary
nurses, clinical leaders, and clients to understand (1) barriers/facilitators to implementing VDOT, (2)
opportunities to improve video-DOT and future implementations, and (3) perspectives regarding clients and
circumstances for which video-DOT is useful. The findings of this research will inform efforts to disseminate
and implement video-DOT for methadone more broadly to expand access and improve patient-centered care
and outcomes for persons with OUD."

To improve patient outcomes, BioAesthetics is developing a drug-eluting acellular dermal graft forsingle-stage reconstruction of full-thickness burns.
Nearly half a million Americans are affected each year by burns requiring medical treatment, with nearly 40,000
patients needing to be hospitalized. The annual medical cost of burns is $1.5 billion. Burn wounds have a long-
lasting impact on health-related quality of life and affect both physical and mental health. Infections are the most
frequent wound healing complication, with up to a third of patients with burns developing infections, and are the
leading cause of death.
Our innovation lies in creating a transformative acellular biologic graft (ABG) that enables sustained, local release
of therapeutic agents at the burn site. Our novel approach simultaneously provides a native dermal scaffold for
patient-mediated tissue regeneration, while countering the onset of complications due to infection during the
course of wound healing. Donor tissue processed with BioAesthetics’ patent-pending method to remove cells
and immunogens (i.e., ABGs) have been show to support host-mediated tissue recellularization. To create ABGs
that enable therapeutic agent release, BioAesthetics has developed a patent-pending polymer impregnation
technique that generates hydrogel-based drug delivery systems within ABGs.
In our Phase I project, BioAesthetics assessed the feasibility of this innovative product for treating third-degree
burns and demonstrated that the ABGs are efficacious in porcine third-degree burn wound healing and infection
barrier models. In this Phase II project, we propose further product development, related to clinical manufacturing
of the graft, including evaluating donor tissue variability and terminal sterilization effects, and expansion of the
preclinical testing to include porcine third-degree burn infected and uninfected wound healing and barrier function
models. Following completion of these studies, the product will be poised for FDA regulatory filings. Ultimately,
our goal is to improve clinical outcomes for patients by reducing complications that arise from burn wounds."

This SBIR Phase II project proposes a sterilization device that operate at low temperatures, works with complex geometries, and is low energy and low cost. These areas are not currently addressed by one single, state-of-the-art sterilization technology. The solution is based on an active plasma module (APM). Previously, research established APM efficacy against SARS CoV-2 and its surrogate on metal, plastic, and fabric, and the required operating conditions (exposure times, ozone requirements, and power) to achieve sterilization. The objectives in this project include prototype development with (i) efficacy tests against BioSafety Level (BSL)-2 and -3 pathogens, (ii) cycle times, ozone requirements, and power demands, (iii) a practical ozone removal system to meet safety limits, (iv) material compatibility data, and (v) a user-friendly control interface.The team will also examine APM quality control, the ability to meet required product specifications, and management of the reverse-engineering threat.Successful Phase II completion will result in a market-ready prototype with sterilization data against various pathogens and product specifications required for customer adoption. The project will advance research on power efficient ozone sterilization._x000D_

Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) is a common inherited heart disease that can cause major limitations to
daily acts of living, poor prognosis, and mortality. There are as many as 1.5 M people with HCM in the US alone, 2/3 of
whom have the obstructive form of the disease with over 50k remaining refractory to medical management and are
candidates for septal reduction therapy (SRT). Despite this, only ~1,200 patients per year of the 50k currently indicated
receive SRT, leaving the vast majority of the most severe patients untreated. The reason for is the highly invasive nature of
existing SRTs that cause frequency cardiac rhythm abnormalities requiring implantation of a pacemaker or cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD) and have unacceptably high rates of peri- and post- procedural mortality (up to 10%). Additionally, many
patients are unsuitable for existing SRT procedures due to existing co-morbidities and/or anatomical limitations.
This Phase II SBIR proposes development of a novel treatment for oHCM by precisely targeting the source of the obstruction
on the interventricular septum (IVS) using a novel high-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (HITU) catheter. Our approach
takes a relatively safe, femoral venous approach to the right ventricle (RV) using existing delivery tools and knowhow
within cardiac electrophysiology. Treatment focuses on delivery of HITU to selectively ablate the entire mid-myocardium
of the IVS while sparing the cardiac conduction system on the sub-endocardium (His-Purkinje), thereby reducing risk of
heart block requiring pacemaker or ICD insertion.
This proposal builds upon the Phase I-equivalent work in acoustic physics, and pre-clinical proof of concept with a prototype
catheter demonstrating that, by generating deep lesions in the mid-septum with a HITU, the IVS thickness can be reduced
by approximately 30%. Based on catheter irrigation features and HITU’s natural focusing characteristics sparing the sub-
endocardium, heart block can be avoided even in the setting of extensive ablation in this region.
The aims of this proposal will focus on maturation of catheter design elements and manufacturing methods to make the
prototype device suitable for clinical evaluation, verify the functionality and safety of the system to relevant international
safety standards (particularly IEC 60601-2-62 standards), and validate the safety, efficacy, and durability of this therapy in
acute and chronic (3-month) preclinical models via clinically accepted modalities (cardiac MRI, TTE, clinical pathology,
gross pathology and histopathology).
The information obtained in this grant will be used in direct support of early feasibility IDE submission with the FDA as
part of a future phase of the grant. Commercialization of our system will bring lifesaving therapy to thousands of critically
ill patients every year and eventually expand to treatment of HCM patients in earlier stages of the disease before long-
standing obstructive hypertrophy resulted in irreversible health consequences."

than 60% of kidney cancer cases are diagnosed in early, localized stages. Compared to radical nephrectomy,
partial nephrectomy offers much better preservation of renal function while having an equivalent oncological
efficacy for the localized kidney cancer, thereby significantly reducing the postoperative risk of chronic kidney
disease, kidney failure and cardiovascular events. However, accurate visualization of renal tumor and its
boundary remains a long-standing technique challenge. Although intraoperative near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence
imaging has been tested to identify the renal tumor boundary after intravenous injection of indocyanine green
(ICG), hundreds of clinical cases show that the rate of positive surgical margin has not been reduced because
ICG can only visualize the normal kidney tissues and is not able to selectively accumulate in kidney cancer cells.
While nearly 40 new fluorescent agents are being evaluated in the clinics for fluorescence-guided cancer
surgery, only 2 of them can target and hyper-fluorescently image a subgroup of clear cell renal cell carcinoma
(ccRCC) (~50% of all cases) through ligand-receptor interactions and these two new probes fail to target papillary
RCC (pRCC), the one with higher recurrence rate, and other types of ccRCC. In addition, the complexity in the
probe design significantly increases the manufacture cost, rt100 times higher than that of ICG. The goal of
ClearNano Inc. is to commercialize a safe, renal-tubule-clearable, tumor targeting NIR fluorescent agent, named
“ClearICG” for intraoperative, hyper-fluorescence imaging of kidney cancer including both ccRCC and pRCC.
The success of this project will advance the precision of partial nephrectomy for kidney cancer so that oncological
and renal functional outcomes can be simultaneously improved while overall medical expense is significantly
reduced (~20%). Partial nephrectomy will be the entry market for ClearICG, and its merits over ICG in the long
blood retention and tumor targeting will allow it to further replace ICG in other ICG-assisted fluorescence-guided
surgeries that require repeated injections and higher image contrast (expanded market)."

costs. A critical challenge in the early detection is the absence of tools available to pediatric offices to perform
quantitative head shape assessment during well-child visits. Delays in diagnosis limit the opportunity for early,
less invasive and effective treatment options. In this Fast-track SBIR project, PediaMetrix Inc. has joined forces
with pediatric hospitals and providers to develop and evaluate SoftSpotTM, which is the first mobile digital tool for
3D data collection and analysis of infant cranial malformations at the point-of-care.Head malformations during infancy can be synostotic (i.e., craniosynostosis) or nonsynostotic (such as
deformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly or DPB). Both types of conditions require immediate attention
and benefit from early treatment to avoid long-term health complications. The prevalence of DPB increased
dramatically in recent years, from 5% to approximately 20%-30%, causing the condition to be called a pediatric
epidemic. Craniosynostosis is less common affecting 1 in 2,000 children. To improve the early management of
these conditions and to prevent more complex treatment and associated morbidities, it is essential to monitor
the growth of the infant head at the point-of-care.To address this unmet clinical need, we will develop and evaluate a mobile digital tool that will enable
pediatricians to capture and analyze 3D scans of every infant for the early diagnosis and management of cranial
malformations. In the Phase I of this project, we will develop a novel technology to rapidly capture and analyze
3D data of the top of cranium in just seconds. We will use machine learning methods to automatically compute
the head shape parameters, including the head circumference which is routinely performed during every child
visit, but currently with an outdated and unreliable measuring tape. Our technology will be designed for the
general cranial evaluation of all infants during well-child visits. In Phase II, we will develop methods for the 3D
reconstruction and analysis of the full cranium from a smartphone. We will also train deep learning models to
classify types of craniosynostosis and other cranial conditions and conduct clinical evaluation and user-feasibility
studies.The overall mission of PediaMetrix is to provide accurate decision support tools for pediatric health at the
point-of-care. This will be achieved through machine learning and quantitative imaging algorithms that in
combination with smartphone technological advances will be packaged as mobile digital health solutions
accessible to pediatric health providers at any time and location. Successful demonstration of SoftSpot3DTM will
lead to a significant reduction of the number of children left with untreated cranial conditions in addition to
lowering the associated healthcare costs and social anxiety."

In 2020 malaria caused 241M clinical cases and 627,000 deaths, the greatest numbers of annual deaths since
2012. There were more deaths in Africa from malaria than from COVID-19. There is an urgent unmet medical
need for a malaria vaccine that prevents infection and disease in individuals and can be deployed in mass
vaccination programs for malaria elimination. The RTS,S malaria vaccine was shown in a pilot implementation
program in rt900,000 African infants to significantly reduced hospital admissions for malaria by 21% and
severe malaria by 30%. In late 2021 it was recommended by WHO for immunization of 5-month-olds.
However, it did not significantly reduce cerebral malaria, severe malaria anemia, or overall mortality, or prevent
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection. Of vaccines under development, only Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines have
the efficacy against Pf infection to be considered for prevention of Pf infection in individuals or geographically
focused Pf malaria elimination campaigns. Sanaria’s 1st generation vaccine, PfSPZ Vaccine, is composed of
radiation-attenuated Pf sporozoites (SPZ), which arrest early in the liver stage. Sanaria’s 2nd generation
vaccine is PfSPZ-CVac (Chemoprophylaxis Vaccine). In PfSPZ-CVac, the parasites replicate in the liver,
biologically amplifying the immunogen load by up to 50,000-fold and then are killed by an anti-malarial drug.
PfSPZ-CVac co-administered with chloroquine (CQ), gave 100% vaccine efficacy (VE) against heterologous
controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) 12 weeks after vaccination using 22% the dose of PfSPZ needed to
achieve 80% VE at 9-10 weeks against heterologous CHMI with PfSPZ Vaccine. PfSPZ-CVac (CQ) is
therefore more protective than PfSPZ Vaccine at ~1/5 the dose. However, transient symptoms of malaria can
occur after 1st dose of PfSPZ, and if CQ is not administered appropriately, parasite multiplication in the blood
could cause severe malaria. In our Phase I grant, to retain the enhanced potency of PfSPZ-CVac and eliminate
its drawbacks, we genetically altered Pf to be able to fully replicate, but arrest prior to entering the blood by
deleting first one and then a 2nd gene to produce PfSPZ-LARC2 Vaccine and produced a master cell bank
(MCB). This vaccine is now being manufactured in compliance with cGMPs to produce PfSPZ-LARC2 Vaccine
and will be assessed for safety and efficacy in a clinical trial in the 2nd half of 2022. In this Phase II grant, we
propose to 1) manufacture 2 lots of this late arresting, replication competent (LARC) vaccine (PfSPZ-LARC2),
which is based on an African Pf parasite, for assessment in expanded clinical trials, 2) manufacture a Thai
strain of Pf (NHP4026) containing Asian variant antigens for regulatory agency directed vaccine assessment,
and 3) produce a PfSPZ-LARC2 vaccine based on NHP4026 that can be combined with African LARC2 as a
pan-global vaccine if needed. The project is intended to produce a potent, cost effective PfSPZ vaccine that
protects against highly variant Pf parasites worldwide."

Chemeleon, Inc. is a NYC-based startup that is developing a novel colorimetric biosensor that rapidly diagnoses
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks at the Point-of-Care (POC), such as by doctors to diagnose Traumatic Brain
Injury (TBI) patients in the Emergency Department (ED), or the Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) in the
ambulance, or during intraoperative and post-operative care for spinal and otolaryngological surgeries. CSF
leaks occur when the fluid that cushions the brain and spine escapes through ruptures in the surrounding
membranes. These leaks are largely caused by TBIs but are also a risk during spinal surgeries, otolaryngological
surgeries, lumbar punctures and epidurals and they can also be spontaneous. Distinguishing CSF leaks from
other bodily fluids is a well-known problem for ED doctors, EMTs and surgeons as the leaks often present as
unilateral rhinorrhea or otorrhea, a clear watery discharge from the nose or ear, or as a mixture with blood and
other fluids during spinal surgery. Currently there are no POC diagnostics for CSF leaks and existing methods
require patient samples to be sent to third-party laboratories for results that can take 4-7 days. Treatment delays
or misdiagnoses significantly increase the risk for life-threatening meningitis, infections and stroke. Patients with
CSF rhinorrhea that develop meningitis have also have much higher morbidity rates. Additionally, the weeklong
stay not only causes significant distress and discomfort for the patient, but also leads to radically higher
healthcare costs. In this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, Chemeleon aims to advance CSF leak diagnosis by
developing a novel, inexpensive biosensor that requires no additional equipment or personnel training that can
provide results in minutes, enabling medical professionals to make time-sensitive decisions. Chemeleon has
already successfully developed a prototype Binding-Induced Nanostructured Dynamic Surface (BINDS) Assay
that binds the CSF protein biomarker, beta-2-transferrin (b2TR). This BINDS platform technology integrates
nanophotonic reporter surfaces with b2TR-specific aptamer receptors, where binding of b2TR to the sensor
surface alters the surface energy producing a vibrant color change that is visible to the naked eye. Proof-of-
concept experiments revealed that Chemeleon’s BINDS CSF assay could detect 1 µg/ml of b2TR in 10 minutes,
which is higher than the 4-5 µg/ml found in CSF. For Direct-to-Phase II studies, the CSF sensor will be further
developed to achieve the high specificity, high sensitivity and low readout time required for use in clinical and
field settings. Chemeleon will focus on (1) optimizing sensor performance to rapidly distinguish CSF from nasal
fluid and blood samples, (2) finalizing manufacturing processes for efficient scale-up, and (3) designing and
testing a commercial in vitro diagnostic prototype. Chemeleon’s CSF sensor will provide advancements in
decision-making for head trauma, spinal and otolaryngological surgical cases and present a modular platform
for the development of other healthcare diagnostics."

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a type of extra-nodal non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma characterized by skinlesions resulting from infiltration of malignant T lymphocytes. Mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome are thetwo most common types of CTCL. Although treatments exist, they are mainly palliative with low response anddurability of response without any cure. The objective response rate remains approximately 30% with the currenttreatment strategies for refractory or recurrent CTCL. Despite CTCL being an indolent, chronic disease in mostcases, some patients experience severe debilitating itchiness, while others have progressive disease with
extensive skin and organ involvement. There is an unmet medical need for more effective treatments withimproved response for refractory or recurrent CTCL patients. The majority of clinically diagnosed CTCL highlyexpress the surface markers CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) and/or CD25. We have generated a promisingdiphtheria toxin based CCR4-IL2 bispecific immunotoxin therapeutic candidate for targeted immunotherapyof CTCL. Our candidate drug is genetically engineered to contain both anti-human CCR4 scFv and human IL2fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin. Our candidate drug has demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy in amouse tumor model showing 106% improvement in survival (69 vs. 33.5 days) compared to an Ontak®
-likehuman IL-2 fusion toxin. Our candidate drug is expressed using a novel, advanced diphtheria toxin-resistantyeast (Pichia pastoris) expression system. Our yeast expression system overcomes expression and purificationproblems encountered with E. coli-based expressions systems to deliver high production levels and excellentpurification quality of our immunotoxin. Importantly, the surface receptors CCR4 and CD25 are also expressedon tumor-infiltrating effector T regulatory cells (Tregs) known to play a role in suppressing anti-tumor immuneresponses. Therefore, a potential follow-on indication for our candidate drug is depletion of tumor infiltratingCCR4+ or/and CD25+ Tregs to boost tumor immunotherapy for a broad spectrum of cancers. In phase I of thisapplication, we will perform pilot non-GLP toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity studies in both ratsand minipigs. In phase II, we will 1) develop a scalable standard operating procedure (SOP) for large-scale goodmanufacturing practice (GMP) production and produce enough GMP grade CCR4-IL2 bispecific immunotoxinfor phase I and II clinical trials, and 2) perform GLP toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity studies
in both rats and minipigs. Our goal is to prepare an IND-ready preclinical data package and then move thisproduct into clinical trials."

Cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy is a central and defining feature of the cancer cachexia syndrome, a
highly prevalent condition that affects over 50% of patients with advanced cancer and over 500,000 patients
per year in the U.S. In addition to being highly prevalent, cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy has
devastating consequences for patients; it reduces physical function and quality of life, often complicates or
precludes cancer treatment, and strongly predicts early mortality from cancer. Unfortunately, a pharmacologic
therapy for cancer-induced muscle atrophy does not exist. Thus, cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy
represents a highly significant unmet medical need with broad relevance to cancer patients. A major goal of
Emmyon, Inc. is to discover and develop a pharmacologic therapy for cancer-induced skeletal muscle
atrophy. To that end, we recently discovered a natural compound that significantly reduces cancer-induced
muscle atrophy in five well-established and distinct in vivo mouse models of cancer. We then used that natural
compound as a lead in medicinal chemistry program and discovered and patented a confidential and
proprietary chemical derivative (EMMY1-06) that appears to be significantly more potent and more efficacious
than the lead compound in at least two distinct mouse models of cancer-induced muscle atrophy. In this
Phase II SBIR proposal, we seek to continue this exciting work by advancing the development of
EMMY1-06 and related molecules as pharmaceuticals for cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy.
Specifically, we will further investigate EMMY1-06's safety, efficacy, and mechanisms of action in several
distinct and complementary mouse models of cancer-induced muscle atrophy that involve multiple tumor types,
sexes, and ages; these studies will significantly advance EMMY1-06 towards clinical development and
commercialization in SBIR Phase III. In parallel to our detailed studies of EMMY1-06, we will also design,
synthesize, and characterize novel compounds that are structurally related to EMMY1-06, seeking to discover
additional compounds with pharmacologic properties that are similar to or perhaps even better than those of
EMMY1-06 in preclinical models of cancer-induced muscle atrophy. Together, these studies will rigorously
advance the scientific understanding and commercial development of a highly promising new class of
pharmaceutical agents. Through this work, we hope to ultimately discover and develop a new
pharmacologic therapy that could broadly improve clinical outcomes for millions of patients who
suffer from cancer."

This problem is exacerbated by the evolving complexity and specialization of surgical procedures and devices. The proposed technology combines lifelike, physical simulated procedures, novel sensing technologies, and machine-learned data analytics to address a universal market need for data-driven training. The technology developed during this project will result in surgical simulation platforms to improve procedural competency and the ability to practice device deployment outside of the operating room, while providing critical data-driven insight into surgical performance and quantitative evaluation. Ultimately, this solution could reduce patient costs, improve outcomes, and expedite medical device development and adoption. _x000D_

The proposed project will result in the development of a comprehensive system that collects data and evaluates vascular surgical operative performance in both the open and endovascular fields. An open vascular surgery simulation platform previously developed to train surgeons will be expanded to include endovascular procedures and the integration of capacitive sensors to capture a comprehensive set of operative performance data. This project aims to use artificial intelligence to classify key performance metrics from the collected dataset to build a comprehensive model to classify operative performance. A data-driven platform for surgical training and medical device development is not currently commercially available and the industry currently relies on increasingly cost-prohibitive means to provide vital surgical training._x000D_

Despite decades of research and commercial effort, society has yet to realize the widespread availability of affordable robots that can safely work alongside humans and assist them in their daily lives. A central obstacle in achieving this vision is the prohibitive cost and poor performance of actuators. Efficient, lightweight clutches that can improve robot operation time and safety at a competitive price are a gateway to the proliferation of human-assistive robotic systems into everyday life. For example, inexpensive motion assistance exoskeletons could improve the quality of life for millions of physically impaired people who are otherwise unable to engage in normal daily activities. Affordable robots could also increase access to expensive labor-intensive services, such as daily physical rehabilitation or full/part-time in-home care._x000D_

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be used to develop new materials understanding and correlate parameters such as morphology, dielectric thickness, and chemical modification to rotary electroadhesive clutch performance. The materials will be assessed for electrical and physical properties, as well as ease of incorporation into electroadhesive clutch assemblies and lifetime. Selecting optimal materials will improve fundamental performance while continuing to lower the weight, footprint, and energy consumption of rotary clutch designs. These research and development activities will de-risk the technology and enable the construction of a production-ready product. To efficiently achieve these goals, testing capabilities will be improved through the development of automated test stands to aid in rapid materials assessment, lifetime testing, and iterative design. For fundamental materials understanding, novel testing protocols will be developed that assess the electrical and wear properties of new materials, producing a widespread scientific impact in fields such as corrosion, coatings, and adhesion._x000D_

Corneal blindness leads to an increased risk of physical harm, mental disorders, social isolation, and cognitive decline, resulting in an over 15-year reduction in life expectancy. Fortunately, 95% of corneal diseases can be treated via a transplant. Partial thickness corneal transplants are innovative procedures that provide the best clinical outcomes for over 90% of patients with corneal disorders; however, the difficulty of safely and efficiently separating the layers of the cornea to prepare corneal grafts and perform transplants has led to under-utilization of these procedures. This project seeks to commercialize single-use, assistive devices for tissue separation in corneal graft preparation and corneal transplant surgery with the potential to improve the efficiency of eye banks and ophthalmologists, increase access to corneal transplants, and improve the outcomes of these procedures. These devices have a time- and capital-efficient path to improving patient outcomes and entering the $340 million global market, annually. _x000D_

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves development of novel, first-in-class graft preparation and assistive surgical devices that standardize, de-skill, and improve the viability of the liquid bubble (LBT) and big bubble techniques (BBT) in corneal transplantation. LBT is a graft preparation technique shown to prepare grafts in minutes from all donor eyes; however, it is more difficult and rarely used by eye banks. BBT is a surgical technique shown to provide efficient, precise separation of layers of the cornea in transplant patients; however, it is extremely challenging and leads to high rates of tissue perforation, with even experienced surgeons reporting 5–39% failure rates. This project leverages a technology for controlled separation of tissue layers to overcome the major barriers of LBT and BBT and enable adoption of partial thickness corneal transplant procedures. This proposal will test the hypotheses that this technology can provide high quality grafts that fit into existing clinical workflows and can enable safe, efficient, and standardized separation of corneal layers without complications. These studies, in collaboration with leading eye banks/corneal specialists, will advance device designs to ensure functionality, usability, manufacturability, and efficacy in human donor eyes._x000D_

New exergames designed for rehabilitation of the fingers, hand, and arm will be developed and added to the current library of games. Machine learning will be added to the system to create a versatile, engaging, and customizable solution. This novel approach to rehabilitation will personalize treatments that may be more effective by addressing individual user needs with predictive analytics. Machine learning will drive the recommendation system to synchronize the rehabilitation plan with the patient recovery trajectory.

Testing of ocular fluid has been shown to decrease rates of blindness in cases of ocular infections. However, this procedure is under-utilized due to the flaws with the current method for collecting fluid. Because of this, ocular infections can be misdiagnosed and undertreated, which can lead to increased rates of vision loss. Additionally, ocular fluid is an untapped reservoir for emerging biomarkers which has created an unmet need for better tools to collect this fluid.

Although the ubiquity of metabolic problems in pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been known for more than a
decade, a wealth of new details on the nature of this problem presents the opportunity for intervention. A
combination of experimental work in cells and animals and early trials in humans, suggests that these
metabolic problems are part of the causation for PH, and that inactivation of the mitochondrial lysine
deacetylase SIRT3 is a central node in regulating the metabolic defects. A vicious cycle exists in which a
triggering event or mutation increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), which produces reactive lipids, which
adduct and inactivate SIRT3, causing metabolic changes that result in further increased ROS. Here, we break
this cycle using 2-HOBA, a small molecule which can effectively soak up reactive lipids in vivo and our
preliminary studies show that 2-HOBA is a safe compound and in IND enabling animal toxicity and human
safety trials and shows great promise in treating the core molecular defects in PH. Our preliminary data and
Phase I studies demonstrate not only clear positive impact on reducing pulmonary vascular resistances in
Group I and II PH, and both cytokine and molecular biomarkers of disease, but also indicated the potential for
a substantial positive effect on heart function under load stress. In this Phase II project, we will establish the
remaining data needed to proceed to commercialization through the following aims: 1) we will test the safety
and molecular efficiency of 2-HOBA in PH patients in a small open label mechanistic pilot trial with of two
weeks of 2-HOBA exposure; 2) we will demonstrate efficacy of 2HOBA in improving function of the right
ventricle under stress in a well-established sheep model; and 3) we will test effectiveness of 2-HOBA alone
and in the context of standard-of-care in mouse models and large animals. 2-HOBA is an entirely new
approach to solving a molecular problem that several existing clinical trials and case reports have tried to
resolve, but so far with limited success. The specific mechanism of action of 2-HOBA should allow it to
succeed where other interventions have failed."

With the increased use of mobile health (mHealth) apps to improve health outcomes, protecting
private health data is becoming increasingly important. These mHealth apps are offered by
healthcare providers and used by patients for various reasons such as paying bills, scheduling
appointments, sending messages to providers, accessing lab results, and viewing prescriptions
and medical records. With patients’ increasing desire for data accessibility and app data sharing,
it is critical to ensure that patients transmit their Protected Health Information (PHI) to apps that
comply with HIPAA privacy and security regulations. Unfortunately, about 25% of healthcare
providers suffer from data breaches violating HIPAA policies caused by using mobile devices that
come with mHealth apps. These breaches result in lawsuits and loss of confidence among health
providers and patients. Earlier research has focused on mobile device security but has not
checked further how apps store or transfer data securely before being used by remote healthcare
providers or users. A total of 303,867 complaints have been received in the HHS.gov until July
2022 [95], which indicates that most developers, including mHealth apps developers, are unaware
of HIPAA security and privacy regulations. This creates the market opportunity to develop static
and dynamic code analysis tools for mHealth app developers, so their developed products meet
HIPAA security and privacy guidelines. Currently, there is a lack of an analysis framework to
check mHealth apps’ security and privacy risks following the applicable HIPAA technical security
and privacy guidelines. We have developed a framework to analyze mHealth apps for HIPAA
security and privacy compliance for Android. The tool is available both as a web-based interface
for users without knowledge of HIPAA or app security and as a plugin with Android Studio to
enable health app developers to test source code for potential data security breaches related to
HIPAA before posting to the marketplace. In addition, the tool addresses API level checking for
secure data communication mandated by recent Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) guidelines between third-party mobile health apps and EHR systems. The analysis
framework also addresses heterogeneous health data and enables providers to comply with
HIPAA administrative and operational guidelines. We have performed two acceptance tests on
the prototype based on partnering with HIPAA experts, medical doctors, and for-profit EHR
vendors along with the effectiveness of tools for detecting health data security breaches. In Phase
II, we propose a commercial product mSPAiOS as a mHealth HIPAA checker by extending the
framework for iOS mHealth apps security and privacy assessment, plugin support for xCode
environment, and performance evaluation of the product by at least 3 for-profit organizations/EHR
vendors. The proposed tool has the potential to capture the market of the HIPAA-compliant
assessment as a unique product that is not provided by any existing tools."

We developed methods to assemble PbTe into scalable solids using either templated growth or self-assembly. PbTe gels self-assembled from colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) translate the size-dependent properties of nanostructures to materials with macroscale volumes.  Large spanning networks of NP chains provide high interconnectivity within the material necessary for a wide range of properties from conductivity to viscoelasticity. In our Phase I work, we have: (1) optimized the aqueous hydrothermal synthesis recipe for PbTe NPs, (2) completed the development of low-cost fabrication methods that have form-factor flexibility and can be scaled to large areas (30.48 x 30.48 cm2 during Phase I) and thicknesses, (3) designed and fabricated pixelated rectifying metallic contacts to form a p-i-n diode, and (4) realized high-energy resolution (0.5 % at 81 keV) sensors across the hard x-ray energy range up to 383 keV. In contrast to single-crystalline, polycrystalline, or amorphous materials, nanostructured media allow one to increase the exciton multiplicity upon the impingement of ionizing quanta by utilizing multi-exciton generation. The surface-induced reduction in the relative participation of thermal loss processes results from a more-effective de-coupling of the phonon population from the information-carrying charge-carriers within the solid. Furthermore, one can exploit the accumulated effect of interfacial scattering events at the multitudinous boundaries with the nanostructured solid to enhance the stopping power of the solid relative to a homogeneous or single-crystalline equivalent. This quantum dot physics can be exploited to potentially transform x-ray imaging.  In contrast to existing x-ray imaging implementations that measure x-ray generated currents, the EPIC-HXR project will deliver an x-ray panel that is spectroscopic on a photon-by-photon basis, expanding the capabilities of x-ray imagers to enable more precise atom-specific mapping of the interrogated targets, which is relevant for military applications, non-destructive evaluation, and medical imaging instrumentation. During Phase II, the PbTe-polymeric composite material and associated readout electronics will be first optimized for single-pixel performance in terms of detection efficiency and energy resolution. That pixel design will then be expanded into an x-ray imaging array with expandable low-noise readout electronics. That x-ray array demonstration will be followed by the material and readout integration into a 30 x 30 cm2 x-ray spectroscopic imager."

The Joint Project Manager for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Medical (JPM CBRN Medical) is developing Scop-HBT under the Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System - Centrally Acting (INATS CA) program. Scop-HBT has established anticholinergic properties and a multi-dose presentation could improve outcomes for OPNA poisoning and reduce the logistical burden of single-dose auto injectors or vials. A multi-dose 20-mL presentation could provide 10-20 doses, thus reducing the vial requirements of a unit dose by 10- to 20-fold. Reducing the logistical burden by 10- to 20-fold would streamline supplying, storing, carrying, using, and disposing of vials needed to treat numerous subjects during a mass casualty OPNA exposure incident. Scop-HBT was selected as a candidate addition to the OPNA treatment regimen because it has established anticholinergic activity, crosses the blood brain barrier, is anticipated to be compatible with the standard nerve agent emergency treatment regimen and has complementary pharmacological profiles to atropine. In addition, Scop-HBT is approved by the FDA for a different indication; thus an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) supply chain already exists that meets U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) standards and cGMPs. CMC Pharma has completed significant previous work under a Phase I SBIR and additional research programs funded by the DoD. During these previous efforts, CMC Pharma identified a lead and several backup formulations for further development and intends to leverage the learnings from all previous efforts to execute the current proposal. CMC Pharma has the personnel, facilities and long standing professional relationships with subcontractors that are ideally suited for this effort.

VCF burdens
include, but are not limited to pain, functional impairment, increased risk of future fractures, medical costs and
mortality. Only 1/3 of osteoporotic VCFs are symptomatic, and the remaining cases are found incidentally, thus,
the burden of VCF disease is significantly underestimated. Despite this, around 700,000 osteoporotic VCFs are
diagnosed annually in the US alone, resulting in an estimated annual economic burden of $13.8B.With an aging population, the rate of VCFs and its associated burdens are expected to rise. Therefore, it is
of utmost importance to develop screening tools for VCF assessment and identifying individuals at risk of VCF.
In this Direct Phase II SBIR project, BioSensics, in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center will
develop a cloud-based platform for automatic, opportunistic analysis of CT images that include spine. The
solution will stand by in the central imaging data server of a hospital, investigate each non-investigated spine CT
study, and flag the studies of patients that are detected to have osteoporosis or vertebra(e) at risk for fracture.
The clinician providing care for the patient will then be prompted to consider ordering a screening for vertebral
body compression fractures, bone mineral study or both, given the red flag from the analysis. Upon placing an
order, a full report will be presented to the physician.This process is reimbursable under two Common Procedural Technology (CPT) codes that are relevant to
the use of the proposed solution (CPT Code 77078 for bone mineral study using computed tomography, and
Code 0X36T for reporting an automated analysis of an existing computed tomography study for vertebral
fractures). The existing reimbursement CPT code and the significant added value of the proposed solution for
hospitals and clinical institutions - in terms of generating additional direct revenue from using the solution as well
as providing better care to patients at risk – will facilitate commercialization of the solution. In the longer term,
the proposed imaging analysis technology can be used for automatic analysis of thousands of medical images
that are taken every day in hospitals and clinics. This will enable detection of diseases and conditions at early
stages (e.g., bone metastasis and different tumors), thus facilitating preventive measures and better care for
those individuals at risk."

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (pDPN) is a severe and debilitating nerve dysfunction prevalent in over
30 million US diabetic patients. It adversely affects patients by causing sensory pain in the lower limbs,
muscular weakness, predisposition to falls, decreased quality of life, and significant patient morbidity as a
result of foot ulcerations, amputations, and disability. pDPN is estimated to cost $10.9 billion per year in the
US alone, with most costs attributed to the treatment of foot ulcers and superimposed infections.
Treatment for pDPN remains limited despite the significant economic and medical impact on patients and
the U.S. healthcare system. Established guidelines advocate the use of therapies targeting the symptoms of
pDPN, and may include administration of anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and opioids, as first-line therapies.
Yet, these therapies only offer moderate pain relief, with adverse events outweighing pain reduction. The FDA
has approved virtually no new categories of analgesics for the treatment of neuropathic pain over the last two
decades, creating a gaping hole in the development of effective and safe pDPN-specific alternative therapies.
This project introduces a significant innovation in the treatment of pDPN through our clinically-demonstrated
novel water-solubilized Cannabidiol-Palmitoylethanolamide (CBD-PEA) technology. The formulation avoids
first-pass metabolism and mediates multiple pain pathways to provide the best anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant clinical outcomes. Our CBD-PEA drug may eliminate the adverse effects of current therapies,
therefore allowing all or nearly all pDPN patients to experience pain relief instead of only 50% of the patients.
Pure Green Pharmaceuticals (The Company) has shown preliminary success in published clinical data
demonstrating that sublingual administration of low-dose, water-solubilized sublingual tablets containing CBD
(60 mg/day) and PEA (300 mg/day), to patients with chronic diabetic neuropathy, significantly reduced pain,
improved sleep quality, and reduced anxiety [plt 0.0001 in an open-label trial, N=31]. Similar results were seen
in a confirmatory double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [plt0.0001, N=54]. No adverse events were reported.
The proposed project substantially expands the Company’s capabilities demonstrated in two recently published
foundational Phase 2 clinical trials that strongly suggested clinical and statistical evidence for the efficacy and
safety of CBD-PEA in pDPN.
This study will determine the impact and efficacy of the Company’s water-soluble 20 mg CBD and micronized
100 mg PEA sublingual tablet in patients suffering from pDPN. This Direct-to-Phase II is a milestone-driven
clinical trial to validate the efficacy of PG Pharma’s unique formulation in pDPN reduction, by measuring pain
reduction, patients’ anxiety and sleep quality compared to placebo control. This 12-week randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled decentralized trial will enroll 200 patients across the United States."

Infertility affects ~13-15% of reproductive-aged couples in the US. The success of in vitro fertilization (IVF), the
most used Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), depends on sustained exogenous progesterone
supplementation to establish and maintain pregnancy. This supplementation must be administered over 8 to10
weeks of gestation until placental progesterone production is adequate to maintain pregnancy. However, current
treatment options such as vaginal gel, inserts, or IM injection, have several drawbacks and side effects that lead
to low patient compliance. In response to the critical need for improved products for sustained progesterone
supplementation, AnelleO is developing AnelleO-PRO, an intravaginal ring (IVR) delivering progesterone over
28 days to cover the entire ART treatment period (8-10 weeks) with only 2-3 rings. Progesterone supplementation
with an IVR provides a patient friendly option for controlled, sustained release of progesterone with less frequent
dosing. AnelleO’s next-generation IVR technology is based on a novel approach that applies a state-of-the-art
3D printing technology (Digital Light Synthesis, enabled by continuous liquid interface production, CLIP™) to
achieve rapid, cost-effective IVR fabrication for continuous drug release for ART and other applications. AnelleO
is applying historical lessons and previous studies on IVRs to address key gaps and needs to yield better
products. This Phase IIB project fosters progress made in Phase I and in the ongoing Phase II in an iterative,
incisive, rational design process to pave the way to an IND submission. The Specific Aims for this project are: 1)
In vivo GLP sheep safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study. Anelleo will engineer GLP 3D CLIP IVRs with final
design selected based on in vitro and in vivo safety data from Phases I and II, and conduct in vitro quality control
studies. This Aim also includes in vivo GLP safety and PK in sheep for GLP PRO IVR to mimic clinical study
design in human, and in vivo PK for a selected IVR design. 2) IND-enabling studies (10993 ISO testing) for the
selected IVR design. Building on FDA guidance from a pre-IND meeting and working with a regulatory team and
CDMOs/CROs, AnelleO will engineer a GLP batch of the IVR and conduct IND-enabling testing. 3) Prepare and
submit an IND application for AnelleO-PRO. Working with a regulatory team and medical/CMC/preclinical
experts, AnelleO will prepare and submit an IND application for AnelleO-PRO. This work is critical for advancing
AnelleO-PRO as a safe and equivalent or superior technology to current products used for progesterone
supplementation in ART. The pivotal sheep GLP and ISO10993 studies will establish the safety and efficacy of
our product for ART and pave the way to clinical trials and commercialization. The development of AnelleO-PRO
for sustained delivery of progesterone to cover the entire ART treatment period with only 2-3 ring administrations
will be groundbreaking, as there is no FDA approved 3D printed IVR for delivery of natural PRO for ART or any
other indication. AnelleO’s IVR platform technology will offer customizable, sustained, and controlled drug
delivery of pharmaceuticals via the vaginal route, and thus can also meet a broad range of women’s health
applications."

For the rt330,000 Americans that are hospitalized for hip fractures yearly, rapid treatment of pain and surgical
intervention is critical to recover mobility and reduce the risk of death. Parenteral opioids are the standard of
care to manage acute hip fracture pain but increase the risk of adverse events and outcomes, including
delirium and recurrent opioid use. Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) techniques, such as the
pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block, are an effective alternative to opioids that could be used for rt 300,000
patients annually to decrease consumption of opioids and improve outcomes. However, utilization of UGRA in
the emergency department (ED) is primarily limited by ED-specific workflow challenges and lack of access to
the training required for competency. Thus, there is a clear need to increase utilization of opioid-sparing UGRA
for hip fracture pain, and it is likely that a technological advancement that reduces the training and workflow
requirements of administering UGRA is required to meet this need.During this project, an ultrasound-based hip regional anesthesia guidance system will be developed
under a quality management system (QMS) certified to ISO 13485:2016 and 21 CFR Part 820. The key
technological innovations underpinning the development of this product include the following: 2D and 3D
imaging algorithms that highlight bony anatomy and soft tissue landmarks, anatomical recognition capabilities
that automate injection site selection, a novel dual-array ultrasound probe that enables ‘through-the-probe’
needle trajectories, a single-use sterile consumable designed to simplify workflow, and a needle-visualization
imaging mode that highlights the advancing needle to the user. The primary technical tasks during the early
stages of the project period include the execution of end-user clinical usability studies to guide technical
specification development and implementation of machine learning networks to guide the PENG block.
Successful completion of these technical aims will result in the fabrication of pre-production systems for pre-
clinical validation studies that will be conducted later in the project period.Pre-clinical product validation activities will include cadaver and human-imaging studies performed in
collaboration with clinical experts who will verify that the system meets the requirements for the clinical
application. The primary endpoint for the pre-clinical cadaveric studies is a direct measurement of the accuracy
of needle placement for the PENG block, as confirmed by CT imaging. Additionally, a second pre-clinical study
using cadaveric specimens will characterize the learning curve required to reach competency with the system
by studying the needle placement accuracy achieved by 25 ED physicians over multiple simulated procedures.Completion of this research project will result in the development and fabrication of a human clinical-
trial-ready 3D-capable ultrasound-imaging system to support facile administration of UGRA for hip fracture pain
by minimizing training and workflow barriers to utilization."

Once diagnosed,
they are also less likely to achieve blood pressure (BP) control. This health disparity is critical, as elevated BP is
the primary modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. One reason for this HTN disparity: stress. African
Americans report more stress than their White peers, most notably from racial discrimination, and have fewer
resources to manage these stressors. And this stress has significant physiological consequences. Compared to
Whites, African Americans show heightened allostatic load, a biologic measure of the cumulative burden of
chronic stress that is implicated in the etiology of HTN. Stress also exacerbates HTN through unhealthy coping
(e.g., overeating, alcohol use) and poorer adherence to antihypertensive medications.Research shows that stress management (SM) interventions improve HTN. Despite this, SM training is not
regularly deployed to manage BP, often because health care settings lack the resources to deliver it. One cost-
effective, easily scalable solution is mobile phones (i.e., mHealth). Importantly, 98% of African Americans own
a mobile phone. Most are smartphones (83%). And text messaging interventions have been shown to improve a
variety of HTN management lifestyle changes (e.g., smoking reduction, physical activity enhancement).There is no mobile cognitive behavioral SM intervention (m-CBSMi) on the market today that is designed
to help African American men manage racial and nonracial sources of stress in an effort to reduce HTN
disparities. The proposed intervention will fill this void. Using proven CBSMi techniques, Black men will learn
how to manage stress and reduce BP through text messages and integrated videos. Educational texts will
increase knowledge, develop skills, and reduce barriers to adaptive coping. Supportive texts will promote
gender and ethnic pride. A library of interactive videos will allow a user to choose tailored training and content
based on his personal needs and experiences (e.g., utilizing a choose-your-own-adventure style). All videos will
be accessible through links embedded within text messages, making it effortless to view them.In Phase I, a prototype m-CBSMI was developed. This development was informed by formative research
with 20 African American men across the lifespan. The results of Phase I strongly support the feasibility and
potential effectiveness of the intervention, far exceeding the benchmarks established in the Phase I proposal.During Phase II, the m-CBSMi for African American men will be fully developed. Then, in partnership with
Family and Medical Counseling Service, the effectiveness of the m-CBSMi to reduce BP among hypertensive
African American men will be examined. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention
condition or to a matched control condition. Secondary measures will assess subjective stress, use of
antihypertensive medications, coping, well-being, gendered racial identity, and knowledge."

Uroflowmetry is the most common urodynamic test performed by urologists to assess the function of the lower
urinary tract. This simple non-invasive study measures urinary flow rates and when summarized graphically
offers insights into various types of lower urinary tract symptoms. Current systems call upon a patient to void
into a commode with a funnel to direct the flow of urine into a vessel placed on a digital scale which in turn
drives its output into a processor. The processor is connected to a printer which produces summary data
such as voided volume, peak flow, average flow, total void time, as well as a graphical representation of the
flow curve anywhere from 20-30 seconds after the void is initiated or completed. The physician or their
assistant will then empty the vessel, and the system can be used again. Traditionally the paper containing the
printed collected data was filed into a paper chart. Today this tracing is taped to a 2nd paper containing the
patient’s name and medical record number, and this is scanned into the electronic record as an image and the
data become non-searchable. Given this labor intensive process which is restricted to the office, conventional
uroflowmetry is ripe for disruptive innovations that will allow for testing in the patient’s home or office with the
data being driven into the electronic medical record (EMR).
We seek to offer a service to address to these logistical problems based on a detector that is paired with
customized software. Our detector fits in any regular toilet (it can be used in an office setting or at home by
males and females). Uroflow data are acquired in real time by a blue tooth or tablet, which sends the data to
the UroGenie cloud based server, and the summary data is delivered into the EMR. This will allow for a
physician to review multiple flows over time to monitor a patient’s progress without having to open up each
individual image. In this proposal we seek to refine our detector, and modify the software to work in the
home market, and test the service in both office and home locations. Once this system is fully operational we
envision this system being used in office and home settings, and playing a role in drug trials for lower urinary
tract symptoms. The instantaneous detection of flow rate also means it has the potential for future
applications in biofeedback training for selected patients with specific lower urinary tract symptoms."

However, software and hardware designs are typically application-specific with a limited user base and minimal support for third-party development. This creates a barrier to exploiting the technology for Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and private sector domains. Meanwhile, commodity devices represent a computing platform with a rich set of processing and sensing capacities that are continually upgraded at commercial timescales, making them an attractive and ubiquitous target for hosting beamforming applications. Synoptic Engineering proposes to develop the Commodity Coherent Effects Toolkit (CCET), which enables beamforming and other coherent applications to be hosted on commodity devices. This toolkit will create a “tinkerer’s sandbox” allowing exploration of many coherent effects applications including transmit beamforming, precision ranging, precision time-sync, and emitter localization. Coherent effects using acoustic and RF waveforms can be supported either natively or with the addition of a modest size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) peripheral. The project will result in the following benefits: - Acoustic beamforming as a new enabling technology: The proposed work builds on our team’s expertise to address the unique challenges of acoustic waveform beamforming with commodity devices. Novel DoD, IC, and private sector applications become feasible with this new capability. Enabled application concepts may include covert communication, data exfiltration, heterogeneous MIMO communication using multiple speakers and microphones, and remote manipulation of a receiver’s acoustic-sensitive hardware. - A complete development toolkit: CCET will provide a rich library of software modules allowing integration of coherent effects into applications without requiring deep understanding of the underlying math and physics. CCET will be integrated into a standard development environment, providing a broad development community the capability to test new coherent applications in operationally relevant environments. - Sustainable solution: The underlying techniques enable development of other coherent applications. Upgrades to the CCET toolkit can happen at commercial timescales, track the needs of future missions, and extend to broader frequencies via inconspicuous peripherals. The technology will enable precise target ranging, device synchronization, nullforming to suppress the reception of a signal at a designated receiver, indoor navigation, other relative coordinate system applications, and multistatic sonar. Non-military applications include ultrasonic beamforming for the medical device and industrial process engineering domains."

Pivotal analog electronics determined to achieve widespread benefits from use of sensors include 1) Analog electronics connected directly to the sensor, in front of the ADC conversion, to reduce the ‘data’ deluge’ and 2) analog electronics for robust wireless communication (5th or 6th generation) for fast, efficient control and/or data collection. For this critical ‘data deluge’ need, Alphacore has developed an ‘In-Sensor Analog Neural Network Framework for Analog to Information Conversion” (ISANNAC) technology with 105 :1 compression factor to reduce total data processed while its on-chip ultralow power ADC-based digitization further reduces transmission energy. Digitizing the analog sensor data for transmission to remote location (e.g., cloud server) for processing creates an enormous amount of data. The two key issues with this level of data generation are: a) processing this large volume of data is beyond human capacity which is estimated to be 1017 bits/second; b) transmitting all the data from sensors to remote locations is prohibitively energy expensive. To achieve this, Alphacore worked extensively on two major innovations that realized this concept: 1) to use reservoir-computing (RC) paradigm that nonlinearly projects the analog sensor data into a different hyperplane, allowing for easy separation of the distinct classes in the input signal by a read-out layer (Error! Reference source not found.) and 2) a new ultra-low-power ADC for digitizing the sensor analog signals. Alphacore had set the goal of meeting the following three milestones: Milestone 1: Post-layout design of the reservoir-computer circuit has been completed and evaluated; Milestone 2: Layout of complete in-sensor classifier and characterization; Milestone 3: Tradeoff analysis completed, Phase II schedule planned carefully, and Phase I report submitted to DOE. These milestones were successfully met. In addition, during the Phase I study, Alphacore achieved two additional major technology milestones: Milestone 4: Completed fj/conversion scale SAR ADC; Milestone 5: Completed integration of RC circuit and SAR ADC and sent test chip to fabrication. The additional milestones were to complete the design of the novel “disruptive” low-power ADC and to design, layout and send to the fab the first test chip that includes the RC circuit integrated with the ADC. Phase II follow-on program is hereby proposed where our work is to complete the development of a system that implements this framework as a full silicon integrated circuit. This includes design, layout, verification, fabrication, and functional test of the prototype IC. The on-chip innovation will be tested with a high-bandwidth sensor to benchmark its performance. Reducing manufacturing energy intensity with clean energy methods that implement decarbonization, integrating energy efficient sensors that can function in harsh environments (including hostile temperature, radiation and chemical), implementing methods for efficient, co-integrated sensor node data acquisition and processing, and developing methods for efficient local computing and/or data transmission to realize &gt;10x reduction in energy consumption of sensor data transmissions has been recognized as a critical need, therefore an AI-based data compressor that reduces total data processed by 105 :1 with an ultra-low power ADC digitizer to further reduce transmission energy will be a competitive disrupter. Alphacore’s primary target market for this ISANNAC technology are those using industrial manufacturing imaging systems, RADAR and LIDAR systems, scientific research groups (such as High Energy Physics (HEP) and Nuclear Physics (NP), and medical imaging systems."

Brain tumors result in a disproportionate rate of cancer morbidity and mortality. Standard of care treatment
includes maximal safe surgical resection, with extent of surgical resection (EOR) representing the most relevant
prognostic factor for patient survival. Because EOR is dependent on the surgeon’s capability to distinguish
between healthy brain tissue and tumor-invaded tissue in or adjacent to brain areas that support cognitive
function, the neurosurgeon must balance clinical objectives against causing cognitive impairments. The ground
truth standard-of-care procedure to facilitate this distinction is awake craniotomy with brain mapping using direct
electrical stimulation mapping (DES). Knowing the location of specific functions with respect to real-time surgical
targets allows the clinical team to protect those functions. It is also standard of care for pre-operative behavioral
data and brain scans to be collected on all brain tumor patients. However, there is no evidenced-based platform
that allows clinical teams to choose the most sensitive task to map and measure a given brain region, or to
understand the implications for future cognitive function of removing a specific volume of brain tissue. To fill this
gap, MindTrace Technologies, Inc. is developing a cloud-based software platform to be used before, during, and
after a neurosurgical procedure to improve the process of evaluating and choosing an optimal treatment plan.
The MindTrace platform supports the administration of functional brain mapping protocols (functional
neuroimaging, DES mapping), and the pre-processing and co-registration of behavioral and neural data in the
service of optimizing the effectiveness of brain mapping during awake brain surgery. The overall goal of this
Direct to Phase II SBIR proposal is to further improve the advanced prototype MindTrace software platform and
deploy it under IRB in the context of a research study to collect prospective longitudinal data at 4 major medical
centers. Completion of these Aims will result in a commercializable product and lay the empirical and
technological foundation for the development of real-time AI-based predictive analytics, a large-scale clinical
trial, and FDA clearance. The design of the protocol proposed herein is based on written feedback from FDA
(qSub meeting) regarding the parameters of a dataset needed for successfully apply for Breakthrough Device
Designation. The dataset to be generated by this prospective study will be the empirical basis for follow on
technology development in AI/ML predictive analytics.
MindTrace is the only company to integrate correlational data (behavior, functional MRI) with the causal evidence
generated during awake brain surgery, and the comparison of post-operative neuropsychological performance
to preoperative neuropsychological performance. Commercialization of the platform deployed within the current
proposal represents a turn-key software product that integrates multiple sources of information to enable
clinicians to plan neurosurgery more effectively in support of the best postoperative quality-of-life."

Project Summary:
Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome characterized by dysregulated host response to infection. The
complexity and heterogeneity of the host response has frustrated attempts at developing effective treatments.
In partnership with 6 U.S. hospitals, Prenosis amassed NOSIS, one of the world’s largest datasets and biobanks
that combines biomarker and clinical data for patients suspected of infection, housing over 60,000 plasma or
serum samples from over 12,000 patients. We also curated a dataset of dense time-series data from each
patient’s Electronic Medical Record (EMR), including demographics, vitals, lab results, interventions, outcomes,
and many other parameters.
In this project, Prenosis will build upon previous work to conduct targeted analyses of the individual treatment
effects of corticosteroids on septic patient outcomes. Using propensity score matching on patient baseline data
(their biomarker/EMR profile at the time they were suspected of serious infection), we have identified 1,350 pairs
of treatment and control patients whose samples have already been collected and stored in the biobank. We will
leverage our existing pipeline to measure the 40 core biomarkers on 8,100 samples for these 2,700 patients: the
pre-treatment sample closest to the time at which the treatment patient received steroids, the sample closest to
24 hours after the treatment patient received steroids, and the patients’ final samples to understand how
treatment impacted biomarker profile and how these changes are associated with clinical outcomes of interest.
These data and analyses will serve as the basis for at least three immediately commercializable products. First,
elucidating which patients are likely to benefit or suffer from treatment with corticosteroids will improve diagnostic
and clinical decision support products that are deployable within Prenosis’ existing ImmunixTM platform. Second,
this will demonstrate the NOSIS dataset is a powerful platform for predictive enrichment of clinical trials.
Estimating individual treatment effects in NOSIS identifies the optimal patient subpopulations to be recruited for
clinical trials, which would otherwise fail. Third, understanding treatment effects on biomarker profile and
corresponding association with clinical outcomes will establish the NOSIS host response profile as effective
surrogate endpoints for clinical trials."

peripheral responses to stress. While the stress response is essential for survival, it can become
dysregulated. Hyperactivity of the HPA characterizes a variety of illnesses including alcohol use
disorder (AUD). HPA hyperactivity is characterized by higher production of corticotropin-releasing
factor (CRF) and glucocorticoids.This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a novel biologic therapeutic aimed at normalizing pathologic
HPA hyperactivity. Medications to modulate the HPA axis are currently sub-optimal. Therapeutic
attempts to use glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists have shown some promise in conditions like
AUD and depression. However, chronically blocking GR-mediated effects can be counterproductive
as, for instance, it interferes with glucocorticoid negative feedback, leading to increased cortisol levels
and mineralocorticoid receptor activation. CRF receptor type 1 (CRF1) antagonists have been
extensively explored, but thus far have proven disappointing, possibly because of the
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties of the existing drugs. Therefore, the
identification of novel therapeutics to normalize hyperactivity of the HPA axis represents an area of
significant unmet medical need.This proposal will optimize a lead validated in the Phase I SBIR and establish a stable cell line for
the production of material for the eventual Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies and
clinical trials. Altogether, the present project will lay the foundations for the clinical development of a
first-in-class therapeutic for AUD and potentially for other conditions characterized by HPA axis

new injuries occurring each year. There are around 42000 SCI patients that are veterans in the United States.
Nearly half of all SCIs occur in patients between the ages of 16 and 36, which results in individuals living with
SCI for decades. The lifetime costs of living with spinal cord injury can average up to $5.1M per patient for
individuals with high tetraplegia. So far, there are no FDA approved drug therapeutics for SCI, which highlights
a huge unmet medical need for those patients. Most spinal cord injuries are anatomically incomplete, which means
by reestablishing neural circuits in the spinal cord, those patients would have functional recovery potential. To
initiate the recovery process, injured axons from the remaining neurons above or near the injury level need to
regenerative growth to bypass the lesion site, reconnect to the neurons below the injury level, and then reestablish
the neural circuits. The major obstruction that prevents axon regrowth is the chemical and physical barriers that
accumulated at the lesion site quickly after injury, which blocks the axonal regenerative growth. For instance,
when axons regrowth to the lesion site, the Wnts protein reinduced there will interact with Ryk receptor that
reinduced on the axons, and then stop axon regeneration. To remove this obstruction, the interactions between
Ryk receptor and Wnts protein must be blocked.Advanced from the first-in-class research conducted in a world-famous research group in the University
of California, San Diego (UCSD), we developed a novel humanized monoclonal antibody drug candidate,
VersaMab-101, which could block the interaction between Wnt and the Ryk receptor. After injection into rats
with spinal cord injury, this antibody promoted axons regenerative growth and bypass the lesion site by stopping
the toxic interaction between Ryk and Wnts. The re-established neural circuits would then promote functional
recovery in rats.This novel therapeutic will benefits the patients with acute spinal cord injury by promoting axon
regeneration and improving their behavior recovery. This therapeutic will also benefit the whole community by
reducing the cost of long-term care. According to FDA recommendations in our pre-IND meeting, we propose to
conduct GLP-complaint toxicity study in rats in this grant application to evaluate the VersaMab-101 safety
profiles. We will also investigate the minimal required efficacy dose for rats with spinal cord contusion injuries."

In the United States alone, more than three million peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are placed
each year to provide IV therapies, where in about half of cases navigation through the venous system is
typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Improper PICC placement is relatively common, is
costly, and has serious complications for critically-ill patients. Unfortunately, under blind placement 30-55% of
PICC tips are not optimally placed on the first attempt and require repositioning, which has an average direct
cost of $223 per patient and often necessitates the removal and reinsertion of the catheter line that carries a
4-6% risk of pneumothorax. Moreover, approximately 17% of these improperly positioned PICCs are placed
into the right atrium, which is associated with a multitude of life-threatening complications. Improper placement
of PICCs also often requires referral to an interventional radiologist for fluoroscopic-guided central line
placement, which is expensive ($1,000) and requires more radiation exposure for the patient. Not surprisingly,
over half of all PICCs are administered to patients over the age of 60. Therefore, safe and accurate PICC
placement is critical for providing high-quality care to older Americans. Despite serious adverse events
associated with blind placement of PICC lines, current vascular access systems have not been widely adopted.
The Teleflex ARROW® G4 VPS and the Bard Sherlock 3CG® TCS are PICC guidance systems that employ
ECG for positioning the PICC tip into the correct location: the region that includes the lower superior vena cava
(SVC) and cavoatrial junction (CAJ). While these procedures often limit the need for a confirmatory X-ray, they
have poor and variable successful placement rates (44-84%), are 30-70% more expensive than standard
PICCs, require skilled staff, and have significantly longer procedure times as compared to standard, blind PICC
placement. Additionally, these guidance systems rely solely on the use of ECG, which is ineffective for patients
with cardiac arrhythmias, a condition that affects approximately 16% of all patients requiring a PICC line. To
address the need for accurate, safe, and cost-effective PICC placement, Piccolo Medical has developed the
Smart PICC™ system, a point-of-care catheter system that uses unique hemodynamic signatures of different
vascular regions in combination with ECG for real-time vascular access guidance into the SVC/CAJ. The goal
of this Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) is to support the commercialization of a cost competitive
Smart PICC™ system in the vascular access marketplace. First, we will design a Gen 2 Smart PICC™
system with improved usability and performance, and reduced cost of goods sold (COGS) to enable
commercial launch (Aim 1). Second, we will submit a 510(k) to the FDA for the Smart PICC™ Gen 2 system
(Aim 2). The successful completion of these Aims will allow us to commercialize this refined system within ~2.5
years of the funding of this proposal."

Pathologic tissue fibrosis, impelled by uncontrolled wound healing responses to acute or chronic injury is a
significant problem in many organs including kidney, lung, and liver. Liver fibrosis is a major health problem
that causes morbidity and mortality in the affected patient population. Liver fibrosis occurs in various
pathologies including chronic alcohol exposure, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that can lead to non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and viral infection, and can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A
number of molecular mechanisms have been scrutinized to identify the root causes of liver fibrosis. Among these,
prominent studies point to aberrant Hedgehog (Hh) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling as prime
factors underlying the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, and hence extensively investigated. Accumulating evidence
also suggests the role of Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) in mediating the inflammatory responses of liver cells to
endogenous factors and bacterial products present in the liver in NAFLD and NASH.
At MAX BioPharma, we have identified semi-synthetic oxysterols that act as Hh pathway modulators, both as
agonists and antagonists. We found oxysterol Hh pathway antagonists that also have potent inhibitory effects
on TGF-β signaling in fibroblastic cells and in primary human hepatic stellate cells (HSC). With support from
an SBIR Phase 1 grant from NIDDK, we recently published findings about the anti-NASH properties of an
oxysterol analogue, Oxy210, that has led to the present application. Oxy210 has anti-fibrotic as well as anti-
inflammatory properties that are mediated through inhibition of Hh, TGF-β and TLR signaling. Oxy210 induced
robust inhibitory effects in a humanized hyperlipidemic mouse model of NASH, ApoE*3-Leiden.CETP mice on
a high fat Western Diet, evidenced by inhibition of hepatic lipid deposition, inflammatory cytokine expression
and fibrosis, associated with reduced hepatic cell apoptosis and improved circulating ALT levels. Based on
these properties of Oxy210, in addition to its favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, oral availability, and
scalability, in the present SBIR Phase 2 application we propose to continue the examination of the disease
modifying effects of Oxy210 in ApoE*3-Leiden.CETP mice in reversing already established disease in contrast to
our published report when Oxy210 was administered at the initiation of the disease. We propose to identify the
molecular and cellular mechanisms of anti-NASH properties of Oxy210 by performing metabolic tests as well
as RNA-sequencing studies in livers of NASH mice with or without Oxy210 treatment. We propose to perform
non-GLP in vitro and in vivo safety studies that will provide essential information for future IND-enabling GLP
studies required in our anticipated IND filing for Oxy210 as a first-in-class new drug candidate for targeting
NASH. NASH is a huge unmet medical need since there are no FDA approved therapies, leaving a large
global population susceptible to severe liver failure and the need for liver transplantation."

These energies are well suited to penetrate most objects of interest for these applications. However, in some cases lower energies are more desirable where the objects may be less dense and or made of lower atomic number material since lower energies result in improved image contrast. This could further allow image subtraction and improved object identification. The ability for the x-ray source to be able to generate multiple energies especially within a single unit makes it a very attractive option. Existing systems are either bulky, have low-x-ray yield and are mostly produced overseas, or use radioactive sources with single energy output. Our proposed system will overcome all of these issues. In Phase I of this proposal, we investigated the feasibility of developing a variable energy linear accelerator system based on TibaRay technology. We simulated and performed early prototyping of a linac-based source that will produce at least 2.6 MeV with the possibility of generating lower energies, with a dose rate &gt;5 R/min at 1 m and have a total system weight that is &lt; 90 lbs. Our company, TibaRay Inc. is actively developing RF components including linacs for use in our novel medical accelerator application. These are based on recent technology developed at SLAC and improved at TibaRay. This involves new approaches to designing highly efficient resonant cavities and for manufacturing them. The proposed linac was designed based on this concept of distributed coupling source with our new addition of calculations to account for beam loading. It will operate at X-band frequencies that area a standard for medical and industrial applications as well as for large research accelerators. It will be powered by a commercial RF source with the electrical power being provided by a power modulator based on a concept developed at TibaRay. This modulator uses the concept of distributed Marx capacitor bank where lower voltage boards are stacked up as per requirement to generate the high voltage. In Phase II we plan to build and test the complete x-ray system (variable energy linac, modulator, low-level RF system, cooling system, beam-monitoring system, control system, interlock and safety system and mechanical assembly). We will calibrate the variable energy performance and benchmark the measurements against simulated output. We will build two iterations of the system and optimize the performance.

Chemelectronics LLC will team up with the University of California, Los Angeles to development and commercialization of nanocomposite monoliths comprising high-Z nanoparticles for gamma-ray spectroscopy in portal monitors. These nanocomposites retain high optical transparency at nanoparticles loadings up to 60 wt%. Measured scintillation light yields are much higher than plastic scintillators loaded with high-Z organo-metallic compounds, with nanosecond decay time. The composition and synthetic chemical of the polymer matrix will also be investigated to enhance the light yield and scalability at low cost (expected to be 1000 cm3 ) to meet the performance metrics required for radiation portal monitors. During the Phase I study, the team modified the synthesis and functionalization of the synthesis of HfO2 nanoparticles and obtained nanocomposites containing up to 40 wt% HfO2 nanoparticles with emission weighted longitudinal transmittance (EWLT) of 79.5%. A new conjugated organic compound, 9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluorene (MF), was used to augment PVT and improved the gamma pulse light yield by 11%. The nanocomposite scintillator ((thickness=2 mm; diameter =17 mm)) containing 40% wt% HfO2 nanoparticles and 20 wt% MF produced a prominent Cs-137 gamma photopeak with deconvoluted photopeak energy resolution of 7.2% and successfully scaled up to 2.7 cm3 volume. Nanocomposites loaded with luminescent quantum dots, CZS quantum dots and perovskite CsPbBr3 QDs, were also synthesized. Phase II of the project will iterate the synthesis of nanocomposite scintillators capable of gamma-ray spectroscopy. The gamma-ray photopeak is obtained by loading high-Z nanoparticles while retaining the high optical transmittance, high light yield, and fast scintillation decay of unloaded plastic scintillators. The synthetic chemistry will be developed, such that low-cost raw chemicals and lowcost scalable fabrication processes can be employed, in order to ease the transition into production for wide deployment in RPMs. The technical objective is to further improve the composition and synthesis protocol developed in Phase I, targeting the performance metrics of solid-state nanocomposite scintillators with volume ~20 cm3 and ~10% photopeak energy resolution for 662 keV gamma. The new scintillators will outperform existing plastic scintillators in RPMs by providing spectroscopic identification of radioactive sources on site and in situ. Furthermore, the nanocomposite scintillators will provide advanced solutions for the measurement needs of high energy particles at the nation’s nuclear facilities and for nuclear physics studies. The nanocomposite scintillators offer the unique combination of comparable light yield, ns-scale time resolution, and low cost of unloaded plastic scintillators, but twice the density and 5-10 times higher effective Z. The low-cost nanocomposite scintillator could solve financial challenges for both healthcare providers and patients to process radiation diagnosis, screening and treatment at lower costs as well."

Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Devices (CIEDs) like a Permanent Pacemaker or Implantable
Defibrillator are implanted in over 3 million Americans, with the average age of implantation in the 60s,
40% ≥ 70 years old, and 28% ≥ 80 years old. When a patient presents to the Emergency Department (ED)
with an unknown CIED, reprogramming of the device is often necessary for their treatment. Every patient
should know their device type and manufacturer. This information is particularly important, as every device
can be interrogated only by a programmer (a custom computer and magnetic wand) from the CIED’s
specific manufacturer. However, in emergency situations, elderly patients may not have their device
information or may be unable to communicate with hospital personnel, leading to delays in proper
treatment. Most often, ED staff use an x-ray to attempt to read the manufacturer and device type, simply to
help determine the correct manufacturer to ask for assistance. To facilitate prompt and thorough patient
treatment, CIED manufacturers typically provide personnel who are on call in or near medical facilities to
assist with any device-related issues. To solve this problem, BridgeSource Medical proposes a portable
handheld device that can identify CIEDs from any manufacturer either in the ED, or in transit to the ED,
eliminating the need for a time-consuming and unnecessary x-ray, and enabling first-line medical
personnel. The proposed device identifier works by mimicking the “wakeup call” communication of the five
major CIED programmers in sequence, and would identify each device by analyzing the response from the
CIED."

This is an innovation that embodies the NIH mission of improving healthcare outcomes by providing
preterm infants the valuable nutrients only found in mother’s milk increasing their chance of survival
and improved overall health. The goal of this research is to tailor the technology to the specific needs of
the NICU and prove superior performance in decreasing feeding intolerance and increasing growth
through two preclinical evaluations. Human milk is the best feeding option for preterm infants.
However, to meet the high nutrient needs of preterm infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs),
mother’s own milk is often mixed with bovine milk sourced fortifiers to achieve nutrient level goals. This
is done despite the bovine sourced fortifiers potential to increase risk of dangerous feeding intolerance,
to negatively impact immune system, microbiome development and even long-term health by
increasing risk of lung and eye diseases. These risks along with the breakdown of the infant formula
supply chain make it an urgent need to find an alternative safer and more available method. The Human
Milk Concentration (HMC) device is a safe and simple solution- it uses a passive osmotic process to
remove some of the water from milk so that preterm infants can receive optimal nutrients from their
own mother’s milk without cow’s milk additives and helps support breast feeding moms providing an
alternative to moving straight to formula. The success of the work will further bring convincing evidence
of the safety and efficacy of this technology supporting the final development phase of the membrane:
preparing for FDA submission, submission and finally clinical testing. Mother’s Milk Is Best Inc (MMIB)’s
Phase II objectives are to 1) create an HMC formulation and casting process specific for a medical device
application 2) Design and test 2 product embodiments for specific use cases and 3) perform pre-clinical
tests to determine the impact of feeding concentrated HM to neonatal gut cell derived enteroids 4)
Compare growth metrics and gut health in mice fed concentrated milk, unconcentrated milk and
formula. Once the membrane formulation has been tested and fabrication process set per medical
device and HMC requirements, MMIB will be confident in the safety and efficacy of the device thus
advancing the technology one step toward use of the HMC in the NICU and milk banks to help preterm
infants thrive."

We are developing a new class of image-
guided temporarily deployable, endovascular catheter-based medical devices that selectively remove specific drugs from the
blood stream to reduce systemic toxicities. The proposed ChemoFilters incorporate specialized materials that bind target
drugs in situ through a variety of mechanisms. During intraarterial chemotherapy (IAC) infusion to a target organ (e.g., a solid
organ containing a tumor), excess drug not trapped in the target organ passes through to the veins draining the organ and
then is circulated to the rest of the body, causing toxicities in distant locations. By temporarily deploying a ChemoFilter in the
vein(s) draining the organ undergoing IAC, we seek to bind excess drug before it can escape to cause systemic toxicity. The
ChemoFilter would then be removed in the interventional radiology suite shortly after the IAC procedure, thus removing
excess drug from the patient. Although paired intraaterial infusion and venous filtration can theoretically be used for any drug
that has its site of therapeutic action in one location and its site of dose-limiting toxicity in another location, the most compelling
application for this technology is increasing efficacy and safety of locoregional cancer chemotherapy.Primary and metastatic liver tumors are among the top three causes of cancer death worldwide. Image-guided
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), a form of IAC, cost-effectively increases survival in this population. Doxorubicin
(Dox) is a low-cost, highly effective, chemotherapeutic agent frequently used in IAC. Dox use is limited by systemic toxicities,
most importantly irreversible cardiac failure. Dox follows a therapeutic linear dose-response model, in which increasing dose
linearly increases tumor cell kill, providing motivation for higher-dose Dox therapy. Our initial project has yielded ChemoFilters
that can reduce Dox deposition in the heart by 46% in animal models. We seek to build upon that success by designing,
building, and testing new devices that can be more easily navigated to the hepatic veins in human patients.Prototype ChemoFilters will be modeled, built, validated in vitro for efficacy, and tested in vivo in a large animal model
for navigability in Phase I by experienced teams from Filtro, Inc and UCSF. In phase II, the optimized devices from phase I
will then be tested for efficacy and safety in a large animal model and a first-in-man safety and efficacy study in patients with
unresectable liver cancer will be planned and initiated. Achievement of these aims will create new minimally invasive medical
devices that should markedly increase the efficacy of image-guided locoregional intraarterial chemotherapy by lowering
systemic drug concentrations and reducing systemic toxicities for the usual dose of Dox as part of TACE. Completion of this
study will poise the ChemoFilter technology for a pivotal clinical trial that would assess Dox dose escalation in any given
IAC/TACE procedure to achieve better local tumor control in fewer IAC/TACE sessions."

Over 100,000 patients of all ages undergo ostomy surgery in the United States (US) annually due to a variety of
pathophysiologic conditions including colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and
ulcerative colitis), bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, and many other medical conditions. Ostomy surgery may also
be necessary in cases of severe abdominal or pelvic trauma resulting from accidents or from injuries sustained
during military service. A life-saving procedure, ostomy surgery allows bodily waste to pass through a surgically
created opening called a stoma on the abdomen into a prosthetic known as a ‘pouch’ or ‘ostomy bag’ on the
outside of the body. Patients are discharged from the hospital within days of ostomy creation and expected to
heal at home using disposable ostomy pouches attached to the skin around their stoma. Unfortunately, current
pouch designs offer little therapeutic benefit for post-surgery edema (swelling) and may not maintain a tight seal,
allowing leakage of intestinal fluid and waste. Resulting stoma complications include mucocutaneous
(skin/stoma) separation, stoma retraction, and moisture-associated skin damage. Up to 70% of ostomy patients
endure these complications, with 29% of these patients requiring hospital readmissions at an additional cost of
$78,000 per patient. Furthermore, risks for complications are higher for high body mass index (BMI) patients.
Given the rise in clinical conditions requiring ostomy surgery, the increased BMI of the US population, and the
current reimbursement landscape that penalizes the healthcare system for readmissions, an improved post-
surgical incision management device to prevent ostomy complications is urgently needed. In this SBIR Direct
Phase II, Fistula Solution will develop a novel post-surgical ostomy incision management device designed to
prevent complications, form a tight seal, and protect the new stoma. This device stabilizes the tissue around the
stoma to reduce edema and tension on sutures, along with holding the skin/stoma junction together to facilitate
healing. In addition, the device creates a secure seal to stop stool leaks and prevent MASD. Our specific aims
are to 1) optimize product design for manufacturability and clinical benefits; 2) verify product design and
biocompatibility; and 3) conduct a clinical trial comparing the device to conventional adhesive ostomy pouches
with HealthPartners Institute and Regions Hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota. The successful execution of our
specific aims will establish device safety and efficacy and ensure the device is designed for manufacturability
and biocompatibility. The human health benefit is a new standard of care to improve ostomy patient outcomes,
shorten hospital stays, reduce readmissions to hospital, and mitigate a major financial exposure for hospitals."

Lung cancer accounts for about 25% of all cancer deaths in the US, as it is often caught at an
advanced stage when treatment options are limited. This has led to the institution of screening
programs with low-dose CT, resulting in ~1.6 million pulmonary nodules detected every year,
most of them (~80%) in the periphery of the lung.
Tissue biopsy is the standard of care for establishing a definitive diagnosis for treatment
planning. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) of tissue biopsies in the procedure room by
cytopathologists or cytotechnicians can be used to establish that:1. Diagnostic quality tissue has been procured; identifying malignancy by ROSE has beenshown to reduce the number of biopsy tools and repeat procedures2. An adequate number of cells have been obtained to allow molecular profiling by next-generation sequencing and molecular testing3. The absence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes justifies the more-invasiveperipheral biopsy.
Nevertheless, ROSE is not the standard of care despite its advantages, because its quality is
highly variable across sites, it can increase procedure times, and its costs are unlikely to be fully
reimbursed. We propose the development of an FDA-cleared medical device that allows
microscopic imaging of fresh, unprocessed tissue biopsies in the treatment room and provides
accurate, near real-time diagnosis based on deep learning.
Specifically, the proposed system uses Stimulated Raman Histology (SRH), which was
pioneered by the PI, translated for intraoperative diagnosis in brain tumors, shown to be suitable
for automated diagnosis via deep learning with a performance that is non-inferior to
pathologists, and resulted in the first CE-certified device for identification of brain tumor margins
by the company. Here, we address an urgent clinical need in lung cancer, giving doctors
confidence in their intraoperative decisions, and reducing unnecessary biopsies/procedures for
patients and payers.
Further, we will investigate the potential to provide accurate intraoperative diagnosis of
molecular markers that could enable local delivery of pharmaceuticals, ablation, and other
therapies, in the biopsy procedure."

Neurological disorders affect millions of patients worldwide and represent a major unmet medical need. Recent
progress on developing new classes of central nervous system (CNS) therapeutics has lagged compared to
other disease areas. A key obstacle in the CNS drug discovery process has been a need for cellular models,
assays, and technologies that can more reliably assess disease-relevant neurophysiological parameters in a
human cellular context at the level of individual neurons and synapses, with the scale and resolution to capture
the complexity and variability of these systems. We propose to address this need through the integration of three
key technologies – (i) our high throughput BRITETM platform for all-optical physiology in human neurons, which
achieves single-cell and single-action-potential resolution with a throughput of ~500,000 neurons per day per
instrument; (ii) genomic screens using CRISPR nuclease to disrupt gene function; (iii) machine learning for
identification of fingerprints that represent complex physiological phenotypes with single-cell resolution. This
Phase II program includes four key objectives. 1) Establish CRISPRn screening conditions in human neurons.
We will select 20 candidate target genes, including epilepsy and neurodevelopmental targets to further optimize
assay conditions compatible with all-optical physiology phenotyping, including timing of genetic disruption and
concentration of CRISPRn/gRNA components for effective knockdown of gene targets. 2) Build deep-learning-
powered analytical tools for single-cell phenotyping. We will use deep neural networks to learn a compact vector
representation of neuronal behavior after pharmacological intervention that leverages our single cell resolution
measurements and accommodates potential heterogeneity in the population of neurons. 3) Identify genetic
modulators of neuronal function using a genome-wide CRISPRn screen. We will combine experimental
conditions and analytical models established in Aims 1-2 to carry out a genome-wide CRISPRn screen (rt18,000
gene targets) with arrayed gRNA libraries in wild-type human iPSC-excitatory neurons. We will identify gene
targets whose downregulation leads to significant changes in functional parameters. Potential hits and specificity
of target knockdown will be confirmed in independent rounds using single gRNA and qPCR and immunoblotting
assays. 4) Predict and validate phenotypic rescue in a human iPSC-neuronal model of Fragile X Syndrome.
Finally, we will assess the predictive value of the functional fingerprints developed in Aim 3 to generate a
candidate list of gene targets that can rescue (suppress) phenotypic parameters we have identified in a human
cellular model of the neurodevelopmental disorder, Fragile X syndrome. We will modulate the expression of
these potential genetic suppressors with CRISPRn in FMR1-/y iPSC-neurons and benchmark phenotypic rescue
using genetic re-introduction of FMRP. Successful completion of the proposed work has potential to yield a new
understanding of the molecular architecture of human neurophysiology and a platform for novel therapeutic
target identification focused on the molecular basis for modulation of neurophysiological disease mechanisms."

Fundamental to the goals of surgery are functional preservation of critical nerves and minimization of post-
operative patient morbidity. Unfortunately, inadvertent nerve injury during surgery continues to be a major cause
of post-surgical patient morbidity due to the inability of surgeons to visualize nerves during surgery. Nerve injury
is a frequent postoperative complication of minimally invasive surgeries, leading to significant patient morbidity
and long-term consequences that can include chronic pain, numbness, urinary and defecatory dysfunction,
sexual dysfunction, and paralysis. Inadvertent intraoperative ureteral injuries additionally contribute to the high
rate of postoperative complications in this patient population. Current nerve identification strategies utilize non-
quantifiable criteria such as anatomy, texture, color, and relationship to surrounding structures to distinguish
nerve or ureter from non-nerve tissues. In instances of trauma, tumor invasion, or infection, nerve identification
using the above criteria is especially challenging and often fails to prevent nerve damage. Using white light
reflectance, which is the standard mode of illumination in operating rooms, the visual difference between small
nerves and adjacent tissue can be imperceptible. There is an unmet need to improve the intraoperative
visualization of nerves and ureters to preserve their function and minimize patient morbidity following surgery.
There are currently no clinically approved agents that enhance nerve and ureter contrast in the same surgery.
Alume Biosciences has developed a first-in-class IV-administered agent for nerve visualization. This candidate,
ALM-488, is a peptide dye conjugate that binds motor, sensory, and autonomic nerves in vivo and enables nerve
visualization with high nerve to non-nerve contrast with no inherent toxicity. ALM-488 fluoresces at a wavelength
that is compatible for potential dual use with Near-infrared (NIR) tumor agents, and thus, is well suited to deliver
on the complimentary goals of enhancing tumor tissue and nerve visualization during resections. In preclinical
studies, ALM-488 labels both nerve and ureter with high selectivity, both of which can be easily visualized using
existing clinically approved endoscopes. Critically, ALM-488 has recently completed clinical testing for nerve
delineation in open head and neck surgeries, which demonstrated that ALM-488 is safe and has potential to
significantly improve intraoperative, real time nerve identification. In this Direct to Phase II SBIR, Alume
Biosciences proposes to evaluate ALM-488 for efficacy to improve nerve and ureter visualization in abdominal
laparoscopic surgeries including tumor resection using FDA cleared instrumentation. They will accomplish this
with a Phase 2 multi-center trial at the University of California San Diego Health and at Stanford University
Medical Center to 1) define the ALM-488 dose in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries involving dissection
of the 1) diaphragmatic hiatus (Nissen, Toupet, Heller, hiatal hernia repair) and 2) pelvic dissection for colorectal
surgery (abdominal perineal resection, rectopexy, proctectomy); and 2) evaluate ALM-488 for efficacy to improve
intraoperative nerve and ureter conspicuity. Alume anticipates that clinical translation of ALM-488 will be
transformative for minimally invasive surgeries to prevent inadvertent injury and improve post-operative patient
outcomes."

and is the leading cause of adult disability in the US with an estimated cost in the range of $34 billion
annually. Approximately 20% of the annual 795,000 stroke patients die within one year and 15-30% are
permanently disabled. Antiplatelet therapy is mainly used for primary prevention of acute ischemic stroke in
cerebrovascular disease. Bioactive fatty acids are a new class of molecular targets that hold great
therapeutic potential because of their diverse role as signaling molecules that regulate metabolism and
inflammation. The oxidation of arachidonic acid by 12-LOX results in the production of a number of bioactive
lipids including the metabolite 12(S)-HETE. The lipid receptor GPR31, an orphan class A GPCR, is a 12(S)-
HETE receptor recently shown to be involved in inflammatory signaling. We recently discovered that GPR31
mediates 12(S)-HETE prothrombotic signaling in platelets and promotes glutamate-induced oxidative
toxicity in neuronal cells. Therefore, we propose that targeting GPR31 may provide a therapeutic path
towards development of a safe and effective antiplatelet therapy that is coupled with secondary
neuroprotective effects for mitigating against the acute neurologic sequela of stroke to provide a more
effective and safer alternative option or adjunct to fibrinolytic therapy. We have recently succeeded in
identifying the first effective GPR31 antagonist using our cell-penetrating, membrane-tethered, Pepducin
technology to be validated in these preclinical IND-enabling studies as an anti-platelet and anti-stroke
agent. We show here that this i3-loop derived GPR31 lipopeptide has potent antiplatelet activity and nearly
completely suppresses arterial thrombosis without an effect on hemostasis in mice. Preliminary data with
the GPR310 pepducin shows a highly significant reduction in stroke infarct area in mice similar to the
protective effect of Gpr31-deficiency. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct neuroprotective effect of
the GPR310 pepducin on HT22 neuronal cells subjected to glutamate mediated oxidative stress. The goal
of this Phase 2 STTR project is to develop the GPR310 pepducin as a collaborative effort between Oasis
Pharmaceuticals (Lexington, MA), Tufts Medical Center (Boston, MA) that would provide a robust IND data
package required to advance the initial commercial development of the first GPR31 inhibitor as a dual
antiplatelet, anti-stroke drug. This drug development program would establish the scientific merit of the
GPR31 target by accomplishing the major milestones at the end of 2 years of GLP safety/pharmacology

Current common methods for measuring somatosensory function in preclinical rodent models
generally rely on withdrawal responses to uncomfortable or painful stimuli. These tests can be
stressful to the animal, while also yielding a high variability in measured responses, and
repetitive testing in longitudinal models may even result in chronic pain states. To better
understand the connection between physiology and perception of touch and proprioception,
researchers need a modern, off-the-shelf assessment system to administer and quantify trained,
volitional behaviors. Under this Phase II STTR project, Vulintus, Inc. will continue to develop and
validate ‘SensiTrak,’ an automated, high-throughput behavioral system designed to finely
measure somatosensory function in rodent models. SensiTrak meets the needs of
somatosensory-focused researchers by supporting complex, electromechanical feedback
interactions with animals, with interchangeable task modules, behavioral peripherals, and
open-source control software. Vulintus’ Phase II activities included finalization and certification
of a common controller and modules for assessing tactile, vibration, and proprioception
discrimination thresholds. Concurrently, SensiTrak systems will undergo beta testing at two
different laboratories at Columbia University and the Winifred Masterson Burke Medical
Research Institute. Beta testing will help establish the reliability and utility of SensiTrak
assessments and will guide the development of protocols for other laboratories to follow when
adopting SensiTrak in their research. At the conclusion of this Phase II, a fully developed

Aura is a digital health platform that uses Epilog™, a miniature, wireless, wearable EEG sensor worn on the
scalp below hairline that can record clinical and subclinical seizures. After an initial diagnosis of epilepsy, an
epileptologist will use known information about patients’ seizures to guide the best scalp location to place the
Epilog EEG sensor (A). EEG data is continuously transferred (B) to the Aura app on a person’s smartphone (C)
using secure BluetoothTM where it communicates over WiFi (D) to the Aura cloud platform (E). Epilog EEG is
analyzed for seizures and a daily digital seizure diary is shared with epileptologists (F) and pushed back to the
Aura app (G). Epilog is recharged daily, and reusable for a year. Epilog is designed to be discreet, allowing for
continuous use in all facets of daily life.
Data are a 10 s snippet of the beginning of a focal seizure with motor impairment and intact awareness (ILAE
1A1) recorded from Epitel’s single-channel Epilog sensor placed on the left forehead. The patient was admitted
for video-EEG monitoring as standard-of-care. This seizure was verified independently by three epileptologists.
In Phase I, automated, machine learning-based seizure detection algorithms will be designed to first work in the
Aura cloud to detect seizures in Epilog EEG, including seizures a person may not consciously know they are
having (rt50% of all seizures), such as while sleeping. Aura will run these algorithms developed exclusively for
Epilog’s single-channel of EEG to provide a daily digital seizure diary.
In Phase II, the Aura system will enter clinical validation trials for FDA clearance as an EEG-based automated
home seizure detection and alerting system. Early in Phase II Aura will be commercialized as a medical
device-enabled-service business model. Out-of-pocket costs for a person living with epilepsy is an average of
$380/year. Armed with long-term, reproducible EEG, epileptologists will now have a more precise, quantitative
record of seizure counts, enabling them to adapt patient treatment more rapidly and successfully to improve
quality of life. Aura will give people living with epilepsy their lives back. Aura provides certainty where you are
and when you need it. Throughout Phase II, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors
will be combined in the Aura app to collect 27,000 days of multi-modal data from 300 patients to create an
unprecedented dataset of features known to precipitate seizures.
These data will be used in Phase III to create a robust, wearable seizure forecasting system using artificial
intelligence that combines multi-modal seizure precipitating factors, creating an hourly seizure probability.
Aura will profoundly disrupt how epilepsy is managed and improve the quality of life of people living with epilepsy."

Such lasers are not available commercially. With new sources of high-brightness electron beams affordable for universities, commercial laboratories (e.g., semiconductor material development), and hospitals, the US would be able to maintain its technological leadership. In Phase I, we constructed a proof-of-principle Demonstrator system and experimentally validated our concept. We demonstrated key parameters targeted by the DOE including wavelength tunability from 484 to 643 nm, pulse energy up to 425 &#181;J, and output bandwidth as low as 1 nm. We characterized the performance of the demonstrator system, anchored our predictive models, confirmed energetics, validated the pulse synchronization, and used these results to design the Phase II Prototype driver. Our accomplishments generated an interest by the researchers at a DOE laboratory. In Phase II, we will develop and characterize a prototype photocathode drive laser meeting the DOE functional requirements. Results of Phase I will be extended using our validated approach. Effective thermal management will be implemented for the PA, harmonic conversion crystals, and the OPA crystals to facilitate continuous operation at high-average power. Wavelength selection under computer control with a feedback loop will be created. Means for pulse selection and generation of the objective waveform will be developed. Pulse synchronization at picosecond level will be matured. Spatial pulse shaping will be provided. Temporal pulse shaping will be evaluated. The resulting laser system will be a full-scale prototype offering a direct path to a photocathode drive laser deliverable in Phase III.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of a new electromagnetic navigation system that requires the solution of several complex problems involving mathematics, computer science and electrical engineering. Millions of minimally invasive medical procedures are performed annually worldwide which include cardiac ablations, valve replacements, bronchoscopies, orthopedic procedures, cancer treatments, etc., all with increasing robot utilization. Electromagnetic navigation systems are widely used in these procedures providing knowledge of locations and orientations when medical instruments are out of the “line of sight”. Currently available systems, mostly developed before the wide adoption of robotic surgeries, can handle only fixed navigation volumes and are often unable to track instruments throughout the full procedure space, which may require the use of additional harmful X-ray radiation. Current tools use bulky field generators incompatible with imaging equipment and provide only limited detection and correction of electromagnetic interference-induced location distortion. This project will address these shortcomings. The electromagnetic navigation system which will have robust detection and mitigation of various electromagnetic interferences, will enable procedure-time adjustable navigation volumes, will allow high location sampling rates with multiple sensors, and will be compatible with intraoperative fluoroscopy and computed tomography (CT) imaging, allowing for key differentiating features required for commercialization._x000D_

toxic chemotherapies. More effective and safer targeted drugs are urgently needed to address this unmet
medical need. Compared to normal tissues, EOC exhibits aberrant proteasome function that triggers
accumulation of high molecular weight polyubiqutinated and misfolded protein aggregates. Because of this
unresolved proteotoxic stress, EOC cell lines are highly susceptible to proteasome inhibitors. While highly
effective against liquid cancers like multiple myeloma, unfortunately the licensed 20S proteasome inhibitors,
such as bortezomib, have proven ineffective against solid tumors, including EOC. This reflects limited tissue
access for these peptide-based drugs and dose-limiting toxicities, notably peripheral neuropathy,
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Up284 is a proprietary upstream (19S) proteasome inhibitor with a novel
target and mechanism, RPN13 inhibition, and a structure designed to overcome the limitations of the licensed
drugs with respect to limited potency (Up284 blocks substrate recognition and deubiquitination by the 19S
rather than just one of the three 20S catalytic activities), poor activity against solid tumors (Up284 has a
novel spiro structure with improved drug-like properties compared to peptide-based 20S inhibitors, and
promotes antigen-representation by tumor cells), key toxicities of peripheral neuropathy (Not clinically
apparent with Up284 in initial murine studies) and thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (Up284 spares the
immunoproteasome and lacks these side effects). Up284 shows broad anticancer activity in vitro, including
against EOC lines selected for platinum resistance, with a robust therapeutic index and a promising safety profile,
and the ability to control xenograft tumor in an orthotopic mouse model of EOC. This promising data reflects our
extensive medicinal chemistry effort to achieve drug-like properties and a patent has been awarded in US
(pending in other countries) to cover the novel backbone and lead compounds. Murine data indicate Up284 has
favorable pharmacodynamics and confirm the novel mechanism of action in vivo. By inhibiting proteasome
ubiquitin receptor RPN13 function and its associated deubiquitinase activity, Up284 produces more rapid
accumulation of larger molecular weight polyubiquinated protein aggregates than the 20S inhibitors. These toxic
misfolded protein aggregates produce an unresolved ER stress, activate the canonical Unfolded Protein
Response (UPR) and thus Up284 more rapidly triggers p53-independent apoptosis than 20S inhibitor. To support
an IND application to FDA, we propose: Aim 1: Assessing toxicity and Peripheral Neuropathy (PN) in mice treated
IP vs IV with Up284 vs. bortezomib (months 1-3). Aim 2: Mouse clinical trial: Testing therapeutic efficacy of
Up284 delivered IP vs IV against 13 ovarian PDX models (months 3-7); Aim 3: Process development, GLP

In the US alone, more than 11 million family caregivers provide care for someone with Alzheimer's
disease or other dementia on a daily basis.1 These family caregivers have been estimated to
shoulder 70% of the total cost of care over their care recipient’s lifetime, costs which include
medical bills and unpaid caregiving hours.2 Caregiving-related stress contributes to social
isolation, loneliness, and physical illness and increases the risk of caregiver death.3-7 Currently,
most caregiver interventions focus on reducing burden, stress, and negative emotions. However,
a growing body of research from our team and others demonstrates that positive emotion is
uniquely associated with beneficial health outcomes, independent of the effects of negative
emotion,8-12 and holds promise for countering the negative psychological and physical health
effects of caregiving. We developed and tested a facilitator-delivered positive emotion regulation
intervention for dementia caregivers that showed significant improvements in positive emotion,
positive aspects of caregiving, depression, and anxiety compared to an emotion reporting waitlist
control.13 However, the expense of facilitator delivery poses challenges to the implementation,
dissemination, and commercialization of LEAF. Online self-guided programs are more easily
disseminated, however, they generally lack a social connection which, given the high rates of
loneliness and social isolation among dementia caregivers,14,15 is problematic. In phase I of this
program of research (R43AG065080; Yang and Moskowitz, MPI), we tailored a self-guided online
positive emotion regulation intervention (called SAGE LEAF - Social Augmentation of self-Guided
Electronic delivery of the Life Enhancing Activities for Family caregivers) by incorporating social
connection components for caregivers going through the program individually (vs in groups; See
Phase I progress report). Interviews and focus groups with caregivers indicated a desire for SAGE
LEAF to host interactions within cohorts of caregivers participating at the same time. A proof-of-
concept study indicated that the SAGE LEAF prototype was feasible and acceptable. Caregivers
rated the social enhancements as moderately usable and suggested ways to make the features
more visible on the user dashboard. In the proposed Phase II project, we will further develop
SAGE LEAF to include features to foster implementation by clinics, care centers, and other
caregiver-serving organizations (CSOs) for groups of caregivers to leverage the benefits of social
connections within the virtual SAGE LEAF environment and will conduct a pragmatic trial in which
SAGE LEAF is implemented through the CSOs."

Pruritus, the urge to scratch due to an unpleasant sensation (acute and chronic), is the most frequent symptom
in skin diseases like Atopic Dermatitis (AD). Although the origin of itch is not fully elucidated, treating chronic
itch is an important part of caring for AD patients’ well-being. Pruritus affects sleep, mood, personal relationships
and can significantly reduce quality of life. In fact, the negative impact of chronic itch on patient’s well-being is
reported to be like that of chronic pain. AD is typically caused by multiple pruritogenic mediators. Antihistamines
may have utility in treating acute pruritus, but have not been effective in chronic pruritus or AD. The management
of chronic pruritus in AD represents an unmet medical need, currently without effective treatment options, and
underscores the need for new therapies against novel targets within non-histaminergic pathways.
An important component of the pathophysiologic mechanism of non-histaminergic chronic pruritus involves the
increase of 5-HT levels in the innervated dermis/epidermis. Elevated levels of 5-HT in patients with AD (serum)
and chronic eczema (skin) have been reported. Recent studies demonstrate the serotonergic 5-HT7 receptor
plays an important role in TRPA1 Ca2+ flux mediated pruritus. 5-HT7 and TRPA1 receptors are co-expressed on
a subset of primary afferent sensory neurons in the skin. Both receptors are functionally coupled where 5-HT7
stimulation results in opening of TRPA1 channels promoting neuronal depolarization and action potential firing,
and ultimately triggering itch-evoked scratching. In vivo studies strongly support that 5-HT signaling contributes
to the pathogenesis of pruritus through 5-HT7-TRPA1 signaling. Praeventix has confirmed the role of 5-
HT7/TRPA1 blockade in the MC903 induced AD model. These data strongly demonstrate selective inhibition of
the 5HT7/TRPA1 signaling pathway will translate to a meaningful suppression of the itch/scratch cycle.
Praeventix has identified clinical lead PRA-523, a potent selective 5-HT7 antagonist that inhibits Ca2+ flux in 5-
HT7/TRPA1-HEK293 cells. PRA-523 exhibits peripherally restricted pharmacokinetics and good dermal
penetration/permeability that is ideal for a topically administered product. Studies in the MC903 induced AD
model demonstrated topically applied PRA-523 significantly and dose dependently reduced scratching behavior
in both male and female mice. These data strongly demonstrate that selective inhibition of the 5-HT7/TRPA1
signaling pathway will translate to meaningful suppression of pruritus.
This proposal aims to complete the initial IND enabling studies to permit the advancement of PRA-523 into GLP
toxicology studies, develop the clinical formulation and manufacture the drug product needed for the planned
nonclinical studies. This work will be performed at high quality contract research organizations in the USA,
overseen by the experienced team at Praeventix."

Clinical Need: Sarcopenia and frailty represent significant and growing clinical challenges whose rates increase
with age, and place patients at risk for functional decline, institutionalization, or death. Resistance exercises are
strongly recommended in this age group to promote muscle regeneration and strength and are routinely a part
of evidence-based home exercise programs prescribed by physical therapists. If conducted as advised, patients
can recover from acute illness, preserve their independence, and reduce their risk of morbidity. Current Clinical
Challenge: A major gap in home exercise programs is a clinician's reliance on self-report diaries or verbal reports
that may be inaccurate or may be subject to recall bias. Remote patient monitoring systems that measure, track,
analyze, and provide patient-oriented feedback may overcome these limitations and have the potential to
enhance exercise adherence. An at-home device that monitors and transmits exercise data to the user and
clinician represents a potential solution to this clinical challenge. Our product – BandPass – SynchroHealth is
a small business entity that developed a remote monitoring solution to fulfil this market need. BandPass consists
of a remote-sensing, Bluetooth-enabled, resistance exercise band that will accurately gauge force through
potentiometric and multi-axial sensors, rigidly fixed to elastic-tubing purposely designed for resistance exercise
training. The device is visually similar to currently available exercise bands familiar to clinicians and patients.
However, the device has a significantly novel addition of integrating force monitoring while connecting to the
cloud through a patient app. A mobile app and a clinician cloud-based platform will provide computational
resources for data visualization, storage, and analysis. This will enable direct patient feedback, clinical monitoring
of patient compliance and progress, and will serve as a platform for more advanced operations such as automatic
exercise-type classification to ease user burden (e.g., minimizing required interactions between the user and
mobile device). Specific Objectives: We propose to commercialize the custom design electronics and housing
for BandPass and perform in-lab validation studies of device accuracy, precision, and long-term stability.
BandPass will be interfaced to a mobile app and cloud-based platform for its data transmission, storage, and
analysis. We will collect data on correct and incorrect usage of BandPass to drive classification algorithms that
will facilitate automatic guidance to patients in completing effective exercise programs. Then, we will conduct a
user-centered design study to examine how to communicate data to patients and clinicians. Finally, we will
deploy BandPass in a pilot study to show initial efficacy at home. Future Directions: SynchroHealth's vision is
to develop a mobile health, user-friendly platform using internet-connected devices to improve the quality of life
and physical function of older adults. At the end of Phase II, we will have demonstrated BandPass' functionality
by providing evidence that it can be deployed at home. This will position us for commercial success by preparing
this Class II exempt medical device for marketing, production, and execution of commercial engagements."

fastest growing animal model of human disease in medical research today. Thus, the health and wellbeing of
medical research fish is paramount as the rigor and repeatability of experiments depends on it. Innovation in
zebrafish husbandry systems is crucially needed because current state-of-the-art non intrusive systems only
track water quality measures. No commercial husbandry system has adopted automatic monitoring of fish
behavior using video, despite the fact that most factors crucial in assessing fish health and well being, such as
hunger, anxiety, or light changes, produce well known behavioral signatures that a computer vision system
could detect. Because many such signatures require high temporal resolution, milliseconds in the case of
escape movements, video monitoring has been hampered by the need to create and process enormous data
volumes. Here, the proposed effort aims at building upon our Phase I success of prototyping the
proof-of-concept system codenamed “CanaryTanks”. We have installed CanaryTank with sentinel zebrafish
populations directly into the racks of an existing fish facility and used our original ""Remanent Imaging""
paradigm to monitor and analyze fish swimming behavior. The system is capable of producing email reports of
basic measures of activity, sleep and feeding as well as alerts when light cycles are disrupted.In this Phase II effort, we will improve our initial designs with commercialization in mind. The first aim builds
on our current design to improve deployability and enhance behavior detection capabilities by capturing 3D
data with a single camera. The second aim is (1) to enhance our system’s ability to build rich email reports and
a dashboard for users to explore replay events as well as historical data, and (2) to develop advanced
detection and diagnostic algorithms using machine learning techniques. Sharing of curated data and analysis
techniques to the community is also planned in this effort. The future vision is that the CanaryTank technology
sets new standards in fish husbandry, real-time classification of complex behavior changes, and provides
revolutionary, ubiquitous in-tank recording capabilities that can be leveraged beyond husbandry for collection of
actual scientific experimental data."

Despite advances in the treatment of ocular diseases, vision-threatening disease or eye injury remain the top 10
disabilities among adults. Several of these ocular conditions require an anterior chamber paracentesis (ACP).
ACP is clinically indicated to reduce acutely elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) to avoid risk of permanent vision
loss and to sample aqueous humor for disease diagnostics and monitoring. Conditions requiring IOP reduction
include acute angle closure glaucoma, pneumatic retinopexy to treat retinal detachments, and iatrogenic IOP
elevations associated with intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents to
treat diseases such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein
occlusions. Conditions requiring aqueous humor sampling include endophthalmitis, uveitis, retinoblastoma and
lymphoma, and aqueous biomarkers increasingly are guiding treatment selection and drug monitoring, e.g., with
anti-VEGF agents. Unfortunately, there exists no instrument specifically designed for ACP, and instead
tuberculin syringes with standard excessively long needles and limited operational control are used. This requires
a steady surgeon hand and steady patient eye while the patient is positioned in the slit lamp biomicroscope, and
often requires an assistant. As a result, the ACP procedure may lead to serious complications, such as hyphema
and cataract due to inadvertent trauma to intraocular structures (e.g., cornea, ciliary body, iris and lens), and the
aspiration rate and aqueous volume are difficult to control and unpredictable. Unfortunately, there have been no
improvements in the safety or efficiency of ACP in the past century. To overcome the limitations associated with
existing antiquated techniques, F Square Medical is developing and commercializing Parasafe™, the first-ever
instrument designed specifically for ACP procedures. The Parasafe instrument is a sterile, disposable and
importantly, safe instrument for controlled, rapid, and reproducible ACP without requiring a slit lamp or an
assistant. Through the completion of a successful Phase I project, F Square Medical built a functional alpha
prototype and assessed its performance and usability to inform beta prototype refinement. This Phase II program
will build upon the substantial Phase I data package and will focus on incorporating feedback from the Phase I
end-user data to refine and lock the Parasafe design for manufacture, as well as execute on the complete array
of required design control activities per 21 CFR 820.30 to advance Parasafe to FDA regulatory 510(k)
submission, approval, and scalable production. The completion of the proposed Phase II project will result in the
filing of a 510(k) regulatory submission to the FDA for Parasafe, an instrument with the potential to significantly
reduce the risk and expand the utility of ACP, thereby advancing this transformational instrument toward
commercialization and improving patient care."

More than 80,000 Americans died in 2021 from fentanyl and other high-potency opioids. The emergence of
illicit, highly potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl is a key contributing factor to the recent spike in opioid-
related mortality, increasing ten-fold since 2016. While the mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist naloxone has
proven invaluable as an opioid overdose antidote, naloxone suffers from a very short duration of action (half-
life ~1 hour) and is less effective against newer, longer-acting opioids, including fentanyl (half-life ~7-10 hours).
This leads to a highly lethal and increasingly prevalent phenomenon known as “renarcotization,” whereby an
overdose patient revived with naloxone re-enters an overdose state from residual fentanyl in the body.
To counter renarcotization, naloxone must be given repeatedly and at significantly higher doses. While usually
achievable in a hospital, renarcotization is often not recognized or monitored for outside of a medical setting
and may lead to unexpected death. A critical, unmet need exists to develop a long-acting MOR antagonist
formulation that prevents renarcotization by providing 12-24 hours of protection to allow opioid levels to drop
below dangerous levels.
The objective of this project is to advance development of CP216, a novel, long-acting naloxone formulation that
utilizes an innovative design to address both primary and secondary overdose through a combination of free
form naloxone for immediate effect and microencapsulated naloxone for sustained protection. This new
formulation will be especially useful in rural areas, where access to emergency medical services is often delayed,
or for Warfighters poisoned by weaponized opioids that need sustained protection while transported to
definitive medical care.
Other attempts to address renarcotization using high or frequent doses of naloxone or nalmefene have limited
protection for high-potency opioids and can induce precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW) in those with opioid
dependence. POW is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition and for this reason causes some
overdose victims to refuse continued naloxone treatment after rescue. Still other efforts to chemically modify
naloxone are subject to significant regulatory and technical risk. Consegna’s drug (CP216) is approvable through
the accelerated 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and is, according to recent studies, unlikely to induce POW and
would therefore gain more acceptance among overdose patients.
Consegna believes this project will have a positive impact on public health by leading to the first safe and
effective product to completely address renarcotization."

animals for chemical toxicity screening,” that is aligned with the needs of the NTP’s Interagency Center for the
Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) for development and evaluation of new, revised,
and alternative methods to identify potential hazards to human health and the environment.
Through our ongoing NCATS SBIR Phase II, Lena Biosciences (LB) developed and commercialized an organ-
on-a-chip-like, Perfused Organ Panel, with a proprietary liquid breathing technology that provides uniform
interstitial perfusion, superior delivery of oxygen and stable pH to 48 statistically independent organ cultures.
In this project, Lena Biosciences will use the Perfused Organ Panel to develop physiologically-relevant in vitro
screening systems using cells derived from animal species typically utilized for toxicological testing. Next, LB
will replicate biological interactions and toxicological responses observed in animal tissues. Lastly, LB will
produce assay data that is suitable for comparisons between in vitro and in vivo animal toxicology studies, and
Tox21 HTS data. Ultimately, this project will provide thoroughly characterized and validated, alternative in vitro
test systems with high specificity and sensitivity to reduce or replace the use of animals in toxicity testing.
In Phase I, LB will develop biologically and xenobiotic-metabolically competent rodent liver and brain models
having in vivo like cellular respiratory metabolism to achieve optimal mitochondrial responsiveness and
susceptibility to toxicants. The liver model will provide high activity of drug metabolizing enzymes for in situ
generation of reactive metabolites, and mimic parallel processes of parent drug deletion and metabolite
formation to better model and predict toxicological outcomes. The brain model(s) will mimic the brain’s innate
immunity with robust toxicological responses to drug overdose, Acetylcholinesterase inhibition with acute
neurotoxicity (Phase I), and neuropathy target esterase inhibition that cause delayed neuropathy (Phase II)

Perfused Organ Panel and 3 sets of in vitro controls will be treated with Acetaminophen (APAP) and Malathion,
an OP insecticide with a neurotoxic metabolite, Malaoxon, that are relevant to the testing of specific tissue
models and for which species-matched in vivo data already exists. This will facilitate benchmarking and show
the Perfused Organ Panel’s utility as an alternative to in vivo models currently used by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. To successfully carry out these studies and ensure the project’s success, we assembled a
team of experts in advanced cell culture models of liver and brain (LB’s PI and CSO, Dr. Shoemaker), drug
metabolism and metabolite formation (Dr. Morgan, Emory, Department of Pharmacology and Chemical

Among many problems that impede medical appointment attendance, access to transportation
is a national issue. Appointment attendance is crucial for patients’ health and wellbeing.
Additionally, no-shows are a significant financial burden for healthcare facilities. Non-emergency
medical transportation programs have been utilized to get Medicaid beneficiaries to their
appointments when no other option is available. Recently, ride-hailing services such as Uber
and Lyft have launched their own transportation services for patients. While these programs and
services have been beneficial, uptake by healthcare facilities has been hindered by financial,
legal, and operational barriers. Our proposal seeks to create a decision-support platform called
Transportation 360 (T360) for healthcare facility administrators to formulate a transportation
strategy that is patient-centered, financially viable and aligned with existing workflow. This digital
tool will generate recommendations for patient transportation options and an implementation
roadmap based on state and federal legal and regulatory requirements (such as the Federal
Anti-Kickback Statute the Civil Monetary Penalty Rules Regarding Beneficiary Inducements) as
well as a healthcare facility’s budget and patient characteristics (obtained through data securely
transmitted via electronic medical records or self-reported by an administrator in a
questionnaire). Factors taken into account in the recommendations will include each
transportation service’s geographic availability, pricing model, cancellation fees, experience
working with safety-net healthcare facilities, implementation support, ability to integrate with
electronic medical records, reporting capabilities, modes of communication with patients,
languages supported, and technical support provided. Characteristics of the healthcare facility
(e.g., location, number of sites, target metrics of success, hourly wages of relevant staff),
patients (e.g., familiarity with texting or smartphones, no-show rates) and payers (proportion of
patients with each type of insurance and reimbursement rates offered by those insurers) will
also be considered. Our team will compile a knowledge base to be used with features including
a return on investment calculator, an interactive compliance checklist, and an operations
planner. A state-by-state reimbursement claims form helper will be available to assist healthcare
facility managers with navigating the Medicaid claims reimbursement process to reduce
payment denials and errors. In Phase I, we will a) Conduct JTBD interviews with a diverse
sample of healthcare administrators and staff members who are representative of our intended
end-users; b) Develop a proof-of-concept prototype that is capable of showcasing the key
system functions (ROI Calculator, Compliance Checklist, and Operations Planner) and reflects
the end-user requirements gathered from the JTBD interviews; and c) Demonstrate the
feasibility of using T360 to support staff’s decision-making regarding transportation offerings. In
Phase II, we will expand T360 into a minimum viable product (MVP), implement a 12-month
rollout at participating facilities, and assess the impact on patient attendance, NEMT claim
submission, and successful NEMT reimbursement."

In recent years, health care systems and physicians have made concerted efforts to practice evidence-based
medicine and provide patients with the best available information when making choices about their medical
care. However, medical decisions are often complex with many uncertainties and potential outcomes to
consider, some beneficial and some adverse. A popular analytic method used to help identify best treatment
strategies while accounting for uncertainty is decision analysis, which typically involves computer modeling of a
treatment choice outlined in the form of a decision tree, which shows options and health outcomes that may
occur as a result of the choice made. Complex decision trees are evaluated via Monte Carlo microsimulation to
allow for variability in individual patient characteristics and trace a patient’s path through the tree; when the
microsimulation is repeated many times to simulate many individuals, it provides the probability of each
potential outcome resulting from the initial decision. From this probability distribution, quantitative measures
associated with each decision can be calculated such as life years, quality-adjusted life years (a generic
measure of disease burden), and others; furthermore, when costs are also incorporated, cost-effectiveness
analysis (CEA) can be performed to compute the incremental cost-effectiveness of each option. In this
proposal, we describe plans to add functionality to the mathematical modeling software Berkeley Madonna to
allow users to build decision trees and carry out Monte Carlo microsimulations and Markov cohort analysis.
Berkeley Madonna’s interface was designed to make mathematical modeling quick and easy for non-technical
users by using a simple syntax and graphical images to construct sophisticated differential equations. We will
leverage this easy-to-use interface to enable medical researchers to perform microsimulation with software that
is more user-friendly, transparent, powerful, and affordable than currently available options. In Aim 1, we
propose further development of our decision analysis user interface that allows users to graphically construct
decision trees and perform microsimulations. In this aim, in addition to optimizing tools and features for the
GUI, we will add CEA output reports and graphics, sensitivity analysis capabilities, and Markov cohort analysis
capabilities. We will create tutorials and a user guide as well as ready-made templates that provide users a
jumping off point for quickly making their own models. In Aim 2, we propose to optimize code for performance
on single CPUs, multiple CPUs, and GPUs. Analysis speed is important because large, complex models can
take weeks to months to run with currently available software, none of which harness the power of GPU
technology; successful completion of this aim would make Berkeley Madonna the fastest available software by
far for performing decision analysis microsimulations. Finally, we will carry out extensive beta testing.
Achievement of these goals will provide an easy-to-use, transparent, powerful, and affordable tool to
biomedical researchers, educators, and professionals, and positively impact scientific discovery."

Metabolic reprogramming plays a critical role in carcinogenesis, in part due its ability to promote immunesuppressive properties within tumors. It remains unclear whether inhibition of fatty acid metabolism in tumorsaffects their immunogenicity. We show that inhibition of stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), the rate limitingenzyme involved in fatty-acid synthesis converting saturated acids (SFA) to monounsaturated fatty acids(MUFAs), increases the immunogenicity of poorly immunogenic tumors. Our results indicate that inhibition oftumorigenic de novo lipogenesis represents a novel approach to enhance T cell-based cancerimmunotherapy. In so doing, our novel lead SCD1 inhibitor (MTI-301; aka SSI-4) singly, and in combination withimmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) using immune competent mouse models demonstrates anti-tumor synergysensitizing tumors to ICIs, as a prelude to an early phase clinical trial. We will also optimize efficacy and seekpredictive biomarkers of response that could be useful for the design and stratification of patients in the criticalPhase III clinical trial. SCD1 is universally upregulated in aggressive cancers and validated by MTI-301 antitumoractivity across a broad range of cancer cell lines and tumor mouse models. Mechanistically, MUFA deprivationin addicted cancer cells leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediating apoptotic cell death. Wediscovered using immune competent mouse cancer models that MTI-301 activates the adaptive immuneresponse via calreticulin/PERK arm of the ER stress pathway enhancing activated T cell tumor infiltration andthereby promoting anti-PD1 antibody therapy. Combined with anti-PD1 inhibitor, MTI-301 sensitizes tumors toimmune checkpoint inhibitors in mouse triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2 breast cancer mousemodels. Based upon these data, our central hypothesis is that aberrant de novo lipogenesis is linked toattenuation of tumor immunogenicity. Three aims are proposed in this fast-track Phase 1/2 SBIR proposal. InAim 1 (Milestone 1, Phase I SBIR), GLP dog toxicology study will be completed to identify the No-observed adverse-effect level (NOAEL) enabling calculation of the first in human dose for the phase I clinical trial. In Aim2 (Milestone 2, Phase II SBIR), GMP MTI-301 will be synthesized and capsulated along with submission of theinvestigation of new drug (IND) application for FDA Phase I trial approval. In Aim 3 (Milestone 3, Phase II SBIR),a Phase I clinical trial will be performed and exploratory biomarkers including identification of immune infiltratesinto the tumor site will be assessed. In summary, we envision SCD1 as a broad-spectrum anti-cancer targetoverexpressed in aggressive malignancies. Therapeutically useful, MTI-301 increases the immunogenicity ofpoorly immunogenic tumors thereby sensitizing to immune checkpoint blockade, leading to dramatic adaptiveimmune mediated tumor cell killing. This combination therapy should enhance patient response rates and bewell tolerated in patients."

This work will develop an innovative infusion device that leverages new electronics and sensor
capabilities to produce a medical device that improves intravenous (IV) infusion delivery. IV
infusions are among most common healthcare procedures administered worldwide; an
estimated 80% of hospital patients receive some IV therapy. Infusions are also increasingly
delivered outside of hospital settings, in homes, long-term care facilities, surge settings and
other alternate site care (ASC) environments. ASC infusions, in particular, are a critical
healthcare trend because they increase access to care by eliminating obstacles such as patient
transportation, pathogen exposure for the immunocompromised, and inpatient costs. While
infusion is critical infrastructure for healthcare delivery, the technologies to deliver it have not
kept up with changing needs in the sector. This proposal builds on a clinically-validated
infusion monitoring system, the DripAssist Infusion Rate Monitor, to create a closed-loop,
digitally-connected infusion platform capable of administering even potentially complex drug
regimes in both acute and ASC settings. This technology-enabled gravity infusion delivery
system with automatic flow adjustment, what we call DripAssist Control, will use low cost
sensors to accurately measure the volume of fluid in a drop. This is an experimental study that
will collect data in silico across a predetermined set of dependent and independent variables.
Large data sets will be collected to which both conventional statistical analysis and machine
learning methods will be applied. Our research will utilize rich information confirmed to be
present in outputs of an existing preliminary benchtop system to establish new data processing
methods for measuring drop volume. Once refined, these methods will be optimized into a
closed-loop flow control system, which will be developed into a form and fit device and tested
within clinical settings with realistic constraints and variability. We have three Aims in this
work. Aim 1: establishing two benchtop systems that can broadly identify the drip volume
rating of an infusion set through a novel detection process. Aim 2: optimize our sensing and
actuating algorithms to clinically acceptable precision and accuracy. Aim 3: perform closed-loop
control system integration and preclinical development work to attain a working prototype
device that can be tested for usability and established regulatory standards. We believe our
work can create a bold shift in clinical practice by introducing novel instrumentation and
sensors and producing a simpler infusion delivery device that matches the precision and
accuracy of expensive pump platforms."

Rodent-borne viral outbreaks are increasing in both frequency and impact. As weather patterns evolve, rodent
populations are affected and may multiply in areas where increased contact with humans results in infection.
Hantaviruses, including Andes (ANDV) and Sin Nombre (SNV), are transmitted through the excreta of infected
rodents and, when aerosolized, infect humans. In the Americas, hantavirus infection leads to hantavirus
cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), a devastating condition that features rapid onset of pulmonary edema,
respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. Treatment is supportive, not pathogen-targeted, and accordingly,
approximately 40% of patients do not survive. Because hantaviruses establish lifelong, asymptomatic
infections in their rodent reservoirs, they are highly prevalent in nature and represent a constant threat to
humans. For example, SNV is carried by the most abundant mammal in North America, the deer mouse, which
has a near ubiquitous distribution throughout the US and Canada. In the case of the South American ANDV, in
addition to rodent-to-human transmission, human-to-human transmission occurs, putting not only the patient,
but also family members and health care workers at risk. Despite this large potential for infection and the high
case fatality rate, there are no FDA-approved treatment options or vaccines available. Hantaviruses are thus
classified as NIAID Priority Pathogens and considered potential bioterrorism threats. Our long term goal is to
develop an effective therapeutic against HCPS-causing hantaviruses.
This proposal seeks to develop human neutralizing antibodies for therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of
HCPS caused by ANDV. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of molecular virologists, clinicians, and
industry partners with experience developing antibody-based therapeutics. The successful development of a
potent neutralizing antibody against ANDV has the potential to be a first-line antiviral for the treatment or
prevention of HCPS."

IAs affect 6% of the population and IA rupture results in lethal hemorrhagic strokes, which account for ~25% of cerebrovascular deaths despite improvements in management. Most ruptured IA patients (~65%) die due to the initial bleed or its immediate complications. Of the survivors, ~50% are left disabled and dependent on others for daily activities. When IAs become symptomatic and medical therapy or lifestyle changes are ineffective, treatment could involve neuro-endovascular interventions.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support development of the world’s first artificial intelligence platform that enables real-time informed decision support for image-guided neuro interventions to treat intracranial aneurysms. The technology uses imaging biomarkers extracted from routinely acquired angiograms during image-guided endovascular procedures and machine learning methods to account for large heterogeneity in patient pathology, neuro-interventionalist approach, and imaging equipment characteristics. The platform includes multiple innovative aspects: 1) a fully automated method to identify the location and extent of the IA, (2) instantaneous extraction of the imaging biomarkers, (3) prognosis of the surgical outcome at one-year post-procedure in a fraction of a second to allow neuro-interventionalist to readjust the endovascular therapy, and (4) full integration with the angiographic systems regardless of the manufacturer._x000D_

Chronic perforations of the tympanic membrane (TM) affect over 170,000 patients in the United States annually,
often stemming from ventilation tubes inserted in the TM to drain fluid from middle ear infections. Left untreated,
these TM perforations can lead to significant morbidities that include recurrent ear infection, conductive and
sensorineural hearing loss, mastoid bone infection, and cholesteatoma development. Currently, TM perforations
are repaired with a graft applied to the TM via an invasive surgery that can take 2-4 hours to complete, cost up
to $18,000 per surgery, and carry significant anesthesia-related risks for pediatric patients. A nonsurgical
alternative to the existing procedure that can reduce procedure time and morbidities would be of economic
benefit to patients, otolaryngologists, and payors alike.We have developed a highly regenerative gel patch called Perf-Fix for nonsurgical TM repair that fits the
existing clinical workflow for myringoplasty. Perf-Fix can be applied to the TM through the ear canal without
incisions or abrasion of the perforation margin, then cured via blue light into a stiff scaffold through which cells
can migrate. The cells degrade the gel patch as they proliferate and migrate, resulting in total replacement of
Perf-Fix with regenerated TM tissue. In this proposal, we will conduct a human study in both adult and pediatric
patients to evaluate the efficacy of Perf-Fix. This human study is the last milestone before submission of Perf-
Fix to FDA for clearance as a class II medical device. During the study, patients will be evaluated for: perforation
closure rate, application time, time to closure, changes in hearing scores, safety of device through adverse
events and failure rates. The endpoints for this study include: TM closure rate at 3 weeks and 3 months, incidence
of adverse events, procedural success, and functional hearing results. The data from this study will be compiled
in a final report that will be included in the de novo submission to FDA. This SBIR project concludes with
submission of the de novo application. The success of this proposal will supply the necessary data to market
Perf-Fix successfully after product launch, leading to a significant medical improvement over the current
standard-of-care with a major reduction in healthcare costs."

Sanaria’s mission is the licensure and marketing of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ) vaccines
against malaria that will prevent malaria infection and transmission in individuals and can be used in public
health-driven malaria control and elimination programs. The aim of this proposal is to shorten the time to
licensure and marketing of Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines by funding aspects of the development program not
typically supported through Phase II or Phase IIB grants or contracts. Despite annual investments of rt$3 B in
malaria control, malaria killed more people in Africa in 2020 than did COVID-19 and the 627,000 malaria-
attributable deaths were the highest since 2012. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine, recommended in 2021 by
WHO for use in young children, has limited efficacy in preventing malaria hospitalizations (21%) and severe
malaria (30%), and no reported protection against Pf infection. Thus, existing tools are inadequate, and a
highly effective vaccine is still desperately needed. The critical need is for a highly efficacious vaccine that
prevents malaria infection to support malaria elimination. Our 1st generation Sanaria® PfSPZ vaccine, based on
radiation attenuated PfSPZ, is safe and well tolerated in 5-month- to 61-year-olds in 21 clinical trials in 9
countries, 6 in Africa. It induces excellent protection against heterologous controlled human malaria infection
for at least 8 m and significant VE against intense natural Pf transmission in field trials in Africa for at least 18
m. Most recently it protected against clinical malaria in African women of child-bearing potential during two
malaria transmission seasons over 18 m without boosting. Additional clinical trials in African children and
pregnant women and Indonesian soldiers will start in Q2/3 2022 using PfSPZ Vaccine manufactured to meet
Phase 3 compliance. Most excitingly, Sanaria has developed a late-arresting, replication competent (LARC)
vaccine, PfSPZ-LARC2 that is expected to be 5-10 times more potent and less expensive than the 1st
generation vaccine. Our progress toward commercialization has been facilitated by a Commercialization
Readiness Pilot Program (CRPP). However, advice from consultants, communications with the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) and US FDA, exciting results of field trials of the vaccine, and the technological
development of PfSPZ-LARC2 have all significantly affected our program. As all of Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines
utilize the same manufacturing, quality, and regulatory processes and clinical trial designs, the overall aims of
our ongoing CRP program have not changed; rather our innovations and developments have identified new
manufacturing, quality, regulatory and clinical tasks not funded in the ongoing CRPP, tasks that are required
for achieving licensure and commercialization of the most potent and cost effective PfSPZ vaccine. This CRPP
will facilitate production of the professional packages responsive to our consultants’ advice, recommendations
from the EMA and FDA, and to our technical advances. Success will significantly shorten the time until product
licensure and launch, and consequently to sales and saving many lives of those affected by malaria."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major contributor to excessive disability, morbidity, and mortality in the United
States. Currently, almost 10 million Americans misuse opioid substances and 2.7 million Americans suffer from
OUD. In the past year alone, U.S. opioid overdose deaths have increased by nearly 30%, resulting in an annual
mortality rate of rt100,000, akin to a death every 5 minutes. Given the scope of the U.S. opioid epidemic, there
is an essential need for proactive, routine, evidence-based OUD screening by an individual’s prescribing primary
care provider or mental health clinicians. However, screening for opioid misuse is underperformed, laborious,
and is susceptible to demand characteristics and concerns about stigmatizing the patient. To combat these
issues, BEAM Diagnostics, Inc. developed Beacon-OUD, a commercializable digital screening tool for OUD. The
tool is based on the theoretical behavioral framework of reinforcer pathology, a widely adopted behavioral
economic approach to addictive behavior. Beacon-OUD is: (1) quick and easy-to-deliver to patients, with
automated, standardized scoring to reduce time barriers; (2) accessible, easy-to-comprehend and self-
administer; (3) non-stigmatizing and assesses risk without disclosing sensitive information; (4) oriented to current
and future, not past, OUD behavior; and 5) interoperable and integrated with a patient’s medical record to
improve the standards for OUD assessment and patient-centered care. In Phase I of this project, we conducted
a clinical study, validating Beacon-OUD as demonstrating robust predictive accuracy of opioid misuse and
receiving positive reports of feasibility and acceptability from providers. The goal of this Phase II SBIR is to
extend Beacon-OUD’s development into a fully realized commercial product, both as a stand-alone tool and as
an integrated tool within an electronic medical record (EMR) system at a large multi-site healthcare system
serving approximately 1M outpatients per year. Aim 1 will optimize the user-experience and accessibility of
Beacon-OUD as a product, produce comprehensive clinical reference materials, and complete a Spanish-
language translation. Aim 2 will integrate Beacon-OUD into EPIC, a widely used electronic medical record
system within a health system partner to improve usability, workflow capabilities, and record-keeping of opioid
misuse directly in a patient’s medical chart. In addition, Aim 2 will launch education and implementation initiatives
to promote Beacon-OUD’s use primary care. Finally, BEAM will complete an Exploratory Aim seeking to validate
and expand Beacon-OUD’s clinical utility as a measurement-based care tool for OUD treatment prognosis. At
the conclusion of this Phase II project, BEAM will have brought Beacon-OUD to market as a digital assessment
for OUD measurement, both as a stand-alone product and an EMR-integrated version."

Undiagnosed diseases clinics and newborn intensive care unit rapid genome sequencing programs have
emerged as the primary settings for diagnosing patients with complex phenotypes. Subspecialty clinics,
pharmaceutical companies, and direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies are increasingly adopting these
technologies for diagnosing patients, or studying disease with the goal of developing treatments. In all cases, a
diagnostic, or research analysis approach based on comprehensive genomic sequencing data, and, crucially,
collaborative analysis by expert teams has been adopted. The team-based approach leverages the expertize
of a wide array of specialists, for example, the physician's knowledge of the patient's phenotypes and family
history; the medical geneticist's knowledge of genetic diseases; the bioinformatician's and variant scientist's
expertise in interpreting the potential diagnostic role of individual genetic variants; the genetic counselors
expertize in synthesizing all available data, and coordinating with patients, families and treating physicians. A
patient's phenotypes, and more frequently, the myriad sources of evidence used to support the diagnostic role
of variants, genes, and their associations with disease evolve over time, and consequently research and
diagnostic analysis is a long-term process. Existing tools focus on analysis at a single point in time, and require
over-burdened genetic counselors to manually evaluate cases for changes, or miss the opportunity for
diagnosis due to a lack of evidence at the time of evaluation. Here, we propose to build a commercial software
system to address two pressing needs faced by consumers of genomic sequencing data. First, a complete
end-to-end bioinformatic pipeline to process raw sequencing data to lists of prioritized genetic variants, and
structural variant calls, which explicitly includes an automated (or manually triggered) data re-analysis pipeline
to support long-term genomic care. Second, a comprehensive, versatile, and yet easy-to-use visualization
platform will seamlessly display all genomic data and metadata to the analysis teams in web applications
custom designed to address the needs of the diverse experts collaborating on these projects. We will evaluate
and refine this product in our undiagnosed diseases clinic and our newborn intensive care unit, ideal settings to
garner critical feedback and suggestions from teams representative of the initial target market for this tool."

Bone marrow is one of the most radiation-sensitive tissues, and patients acutely exposed to total
body irradiation (TBI) doses rt 2 Gy develop severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and lymphopenia
within days to weeks of exposure, often dying from infections (due to a lack of neutrophils) and uncontrolled
bleeding (insufficient platelets) (referred to as the hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome, or H-ARS). The few
drugs that have received FDA approval to treat H-ARS increase survival when administered within 24h of
radiation exposure, but do not increase survival when administered at later times such as 48h post-irradiation
in animal H-ARS models. In a radiological/nuclear emergency, hundreds of thousands of people potentially will
be exposed to rt 2 Gy radiation and it is extremely unlikely that they all can be treated within the first 24 hours
of radiation exposure. Thus, there is a critical unmet medical need for drugs capable of increasing survival
from H-ARS when administered 48h or later post-irradiation. We demonstrated that a novel drug (PEG IL-11)
and 3 drug combination including PEG IL-11 significantly improve 30d and 180d survival of LD70/30 irradiated
mice when administered once 48h post-TBI. This is the only drug/drug combination we are aware of capable of
increasing survival when dosing is delayed until 48h post-TBI in mice. When dosed once 24h or 48h post-TBI,
the 3 proteins interact positively with each other to increase survival more than the individual proteins, most
evident at high TBI doses. The 3 protein combination and PEG IL-11 show sex-specific survival effects, up to
100% survival at LD95/30 TBI doses, when combined with a 4th radiation mitigator, an angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), an unprecedented survival rate. Most H-ARS studies to date have used inbred young
adult mice. Since mouse strains and different age mice show different radiation sensitivities, the Phase 2 grant
will evaluate whether these exciting findings extend to pediatric mice and outbred mice to determine whether
the survival efficacy and sex-specific effects of the proteins (+/- ACEI) are universal or mouse strain / age
specific. We will evaluate whether (1) PEG IL-11 and the 3 protein combination (+/- the ACEI) increase
survival of pediatric and outbred mice exposed to LD70/30 radiation doses when the proteins are administered
24 and 48h post-TBI; (2) whether increased 30d survival correlates with accelerated peripheral blood cell
recovery (neutrophils, platelets) and more rapid increases in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell numbers
early after irradiation; and (3) whether drug treatment and increased survival correlate with specific plasma
biomarker changes. We will evaluate safety of different doses of PEG IL-1 in a mouse GLP toxicology study to
identify safe doses of the drug for use in humans, and manufacture a GMP lot of the protein, both of which are
required for filing an IND to begin testing the protein in humans. PEG IL-11 and TC are potential life-saving
treatment options for a heretofore untreatable H-ARS population – patients who cannot be treated until 48h or
later post-TBI."

optic nerve diseases. Clinical OCT systems (large tabletop devices with chinrest) require a compliant subject,
and thus are not suitable for use with infants, young children, and patients who are unable to cooperate for eye
imaging (such as from physical disability or while under anesthesia or in intensive care). As many of these
patients cannot communicate about vision disturbance or vision loss, diagnosis of disease is difficult to achieve
before irrevocable vision loss occurs. One example of this population is preterm infants in intensive care and
who are at risk for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). While handheld OCT (HH-OCT) has led to significant
insights into the development of ROP, its use for disease screening has been limited in part due to poor
usability of the existing commercial systems due to weight, ergonomics and speed of imaging. The need for
image-based classification of ROP was a subject of the recent International Classification of ROP Committee.
There is a clear need for a commercial, point of care, high-speed, user-friendly handheld OCT system to
improve the standard of care for infants, young children, and patients who are unable to cooperate for imaging.Theia Imaging is pursuing commercialization of the Theia 2 high-speed, portable, user-friendly, hand-held

much-needed OCT imaging of the retina and/or optic nerve head in their patients. This will decrease the need
for examinations under anesthesia and simplify access to valuable information about the retina and optic nerve
head at the time of eye care and general health care.This Phase II effort will build on the Theia 1 system developed in the Phase I, to result in an FDA-
submission for a handheld system that is lightweight, with a small, ergonomic handpiece and imaging at high

Refine the T1 Software into a Commercial Product. We will refine this software under a software quality
assurance system and improve usability. Aim 3: Pilot Study, Pivotal Study and 510(k) Submission. With the
refined Theia 2 system, we will execute pilot and pivotal human studies in support of a 510(k) submission The
expected outcome of this proposal is the development of a commercially viable, 300 kHz HH-OCT system and

Lyme disease, caused by infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi or closely related species, is the most
common vector-borne disease in the United States, accounting for nearly 500,000 infections per year according
to recent public health estimates. It is also one of the few infectious diseases that requires a two-step laboratory
testing protocol, comprising a screening assay, typically ELISA, followed by a confirmatory immunoblot. This
protocol is followed where the disease has progressed beyond the hallmark erythema migrans rash, or the rash
cannot be identified, and symptoms or history suggest Lyme disease. The two-step protocol is a result of the
poor specificity of most Lyme screening tests, which lead to a high false positive rate. This in turn is due to the
cross-reactive nature of many bacterial antigens, combined with the limitations of conventional ELISA
immunochemistry. In principle, a confirmatory result must be obtained prior to initiating treatment, but in practice,
the multi-day delay that is often incurred in this process frequently leads physicians to prescribe antibiotic
treatment in the absence of definitive lab results. As the vast majority of the more than three million annual Lyme
tests in the U.S. are carried out on individuals who are ultimately found not to have Lyme disease, this practice
leads to the unnecessary prescription and use of antibiotics, contributing to the growth of antibiotic resistance
which has become a significant threat to public health. A first step test with significantly higher specificity would
avoid the need for a second step test and enable clinicians to make informed treatment decisions in a timely
manner, based on credible test results.
This project is aimed at bringing about a significant change in medical practice by reducing Lyme testing from
the current two-step process to a one-step process. To achieve this objective, we have developed a novel ELISA
methodology for Lyme antibody detection that enables exceptionally high assay specificity. The test is based
on well-established, highly specific and sensitive Borrelia antigens in a unique immunochemical format. The
novel ELISA immunochemistry eliminates almost all non-specific reactivity, yielding results comparable in
specificity but higher in sensitivity than those obtained with the conventional two-tier testing protocol.
Consequently, this assay promises to deliver a one-step testing solution for Lyme disease, at a time when
alternatives to the original two-step method are gaining legitimacy at the scientific as well as regulatory level.
In Phase I, we developed a prototype ELISA assay, proving feasibility by demonstrating higher sensitivity and
equivalent specificity on retrospective samples comprising Lyme patients and controls, in comparison with two-
tier testing results. In Phase II, we will complete development of the assay into a commercial product, carry out
prospective and retrospective clinical studies and submit a 510(k) application to FDA for use of the ELISA as a
one-step test for Lyme disease, enabling commercial launch upon approval."

Similarly, standard medicinal chemistry techniques for enhancing oxime access to nerves (e.g. lipophilization, prodrug design, hijacking active transporters) have failed to bear fruit. In this innovative Phase II effort, nSI will adapt our Phase I formulation and analytical workflows to handle (a) in vivo fluid volumes, (b) the formulation purification required for pharmacokinetic / biodistribution (PK/BD) trials in vivo, and (c) the use of high-activity PTE mutants instead of a PTE simulant. Using this scaled workflow, we will substitute PTE mutants for PTE simulants and assess impact on formulation parameters (and enzyme activity) for each formulation in our library, and expand our library from 50 to >200 passing formulations. Furthermore, we will continue work on formulation barcoding that began in Phase I, demonstrating (a) that barcode attachment does not impact formulation properties or PTE activity, and (b) successful formulation multiplexing capability in vitro. Finally, for each formulation in the library, we will also conduct in vitro stability studies (in plasma and at 37oC) and in vitro cytotoxicity and nanoparticle (NP) association/uptake studies using primary human neurons. The result will be a large, multiplexed, multidrug NP library that can be co-administered and rapidly screened for in vivo neurotropism in Phase III. If successful, the resulting flexible neurotropic delivery platform could solve critically important medical problems in pain management, psychiatric and CNS disorders, and countering deadly nerve agents."

Combat medics often provide care in no or low-light conditions, surrounded by the chaos of combat, and with the limited dexterity that accompanies bulky body armor, gloves, and heavy equipment. Far-forward medical care is also limited by available resources, which are often only what a combat medic can fit in their aid bag. Therefore, a procedure such as airway management that currently requires a high degree of skill becomes substantially more complex. The purpose of this research and development project is to significantly enhance the effectiveness of one of their most basic lifesaving airway management tools, the nasopharyngeal airway (NPA). The NPA factors prominently within Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) guidelines and within civilian acute care, however, NPAs are not universally effective in relieving airway obstruction, they are underutilized in the TCCC environment, and they are in desperate need of an innovative overhaul. The NPA, also known as the nasal trumpet (because of its flared proximal end), is designed to be inserted into the nose and into the upper airway of a patient in order to relieve breathing obstruction caused by the collapse of airway soft tissues that occurs during depressed levels of consciousness. Upper airway collapse (the airway above the vocal cords) can occur in conditions such as severe head injury, coma, stroke, severe trauma, or anesthesia. The NPA, which has remained largely unchanged since its invention in 1881, has been considered an essential part of hospital and prehospital emergency care kits since at least the 1970s. However, despite the NPA’s simplicity and its prominence within TCCC guidelines, the literature demonstrates that prehospital NPA’s appear to be underutilized within Role 1 and Role 2 levels of care. This assertion is further supported by information within TCCC Guidelines Change 17-01 which states “combat medics have been observed to perform surgical airways on a number of occasions for casualties who were unconscious from hemorrhagic shock or traumatic brain injury (TBI), but who had no direct maxillofacial injuries or documented airway problems.” This is troubling, because the failure rate for combat medic-performed cricothyroidotomy is as high as 33%. NPA’s are also not always effective in relieving airway obstruction. Based upon the known shortcomings of the existing 140-year-old NPA and contemporary knowledge gained regarding the mechanisms of upper airway collapse, we are developing a concept next-level NPA (nl-NPA) which aims to address DoD user needs by effectively opening the entire upper airway. The nl-NPA also aims to be easy to place and to minimize airway trauma during insertion."

Chagas disease, caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is the most prevalent parasitic
disease in the western hemisphere, infecting 8-11 million individuals and with over 70 million at risk. The infection
is transmitted by an insect vector that is native to Latin America, but can also be acquired through blood
transfusion, organ transplant, or congenitally. Following a brief acute phase, the parasite persists for years in
infected carriers, often asymptomatically, but can cause cardiomyopathy and other pathological conditions
leading to severe morbidity and mortality. In the U.S., T. cruzi is prevalent in Latin American immigrant
populations, where it poses an underrecognized health risk. The gradual encroachment of the insect vector into
the southernmost regions of the U.S. has also raised the threat of autochthonous transmission. Chagas disease
is challenging to diagnose due to the combination of genotypic and hence antigenic variation across its
geographical range, complex immunological interactions with the human host, and cross-reactivities with other
parasites. Serology has become the mainstay for diagnosis, especially for chronic infection, but the above
challenges have hampered the accuracy of serologic tests such that multiple assays are commonly used in a
triangulation algorithm to establish final results.
The majority of those at risk for T. cruzi infection live in low-resource, underdeveloped areas where contact with
the vector insects is hard to avoid, but medical care is relatively primitive and laboratory infrastructure is absent.
For these reasons, rapid, point-of-care tests have become increasingly desirable as tools for diagnosis and
epidemiological surveillance of Chagas disease. However, the current generation of Chagas rapid tests is limited
by suboptimal performance, both in sensitivity and specificity, largely due to the reliance on recombinant antigens
which are specific to certain T. cruzi lineages and often fail to detect Mexican and Central American Chagas
cases. To date, only one Chagas rapid test has been cleared by FDA. We propose to complete development of
a rapid test for Chagas disease, based on a native protein antigen from cultured T. cruzi termed TESA
(Trypanosomal Excreted/Secreted Antigens). We have developed procedures to produce with high yield, enrich
and concentrate the antigenic component of TESA, making it suitable for use in a lateral flow assay. In Phase I
studies, the prototype TESA rapid test has shown clinical sensitivity and specificity approaching 100% across a
range of samples from diverse regions spanning the endemic geography of Latin America, including Mexico and
Central America. In Phase II, we will complete development of the TESA lateral flow rapid test in a cost-effective
format suitable for point-of-care use in low-resource settings. The clinical and analytical performance of the test
will be evaluated in a clinical study involving over 1,000 Chagas patients and controls to be carried out at sites
in the U.S. and in an endemic region in Latin America. The clinical study results will support a 510(k) submission
to FDA for clearance of the TESA lateral flow rapid test for in vitro diagnosis of Chagas disease."

Aerosol inhalation therapy is one of the cornerstones of respiratory therapy. The size of airborne
particles determines their deposition pattern within the lungs and therefore, the efficacy of
inhalation therapy. In this Phase 2 SBIR project, BridgeSource Medical (BSM) proposes to
develop a breath-adaptive nebulizer with variable aerosol droplet sizes and actuation times.
This can be used to administer precise doses of pharmaceutical drugs to the pulmonary system
with much greater efficiency than currently available aerosol delivery devices like small-volume
adaptive aerosol delivery (AAD) nebulizers that require strict patient breath timing, but do not
vary droplet size. The nebulizer would be particularly beneficial in the administration of
medications to treat elderly patients with respiratory conditions such as pulmonary hypertension,
where long treatment times and strict requirements on patient breathing lead to poor
compliance. The ultimate goal will be to develop a clinical tool that would be approved by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an effective system to nebulize several drug
formulations targeted for patients who cannot easily comply with strict breathing maneuvers,
such as the those with advanced lung disease such as pulmonary hypertension."

impact our large and growing aging population. An estimated 5.8 million American’s 65 years and older are
suffering from AD, with that number projected to hit 13.8 million by 2050. Aging African American and Latinx
populations are particularly hard-hit by AD/ADRD, as are rural communities due to lack of access to clinical
trials and medical care. A broad range of symptoms are associated with these diseases and each patient’s
progression is unique and clinically quite variable. During a clinical trial, when longitudinal studies are
conducted over months to years, much of the patient’s lifestyle and function goes unmonitored as they are at
home with their partner or alone and without contact with professional providers. Infrequent data collection
relies on the ability of patients to accurately retrieve relevant details about their lives since the last checkup,
which is inherently inaccurate or incomplete due to the challenges of self-report and recall. Thus, there is a
critical need in clinical trials for more frequent, accurate, and complete patient monitoring especially in
communities that are currently underserved. To meet this need, Life Analytics is furthering the development of
an at-home monitoring platform, called Life Analytics Monitoring Platform (LAMP). LAMP is based off of the
NIH and VA funded Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology (CART) initiative system. CART is an
end-to-end (hardware and software) platform, which provides high-frequency monitoring of geriatric disease
progression by measuring real-world data, thus providing a digital remote assessment model to the academic
research community. The CART system was built by, and has been further developed by, our research team in
the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH). Through these efforts a highly functional
generalizable infrastructure for support and deployment of these systems for academic research has been
established. To date, the ORCATECH/CART platform has been installed in more than 1000 homes across
North America and is currently collecting and transmitting data back to ORCATECH servers for analysis.
Additionally, the LA team has shown through publication that high-frequency in-home monitoring data allows
clinical studies to be appropriately powered with fewer patients. Therefore, this platform has the high potential
to change the way that clinical trials are conducted – if such a system can broadly disseminated. This Fastrack
will assist with the critical research and development required to improve the existing ORCATECH/CART
platform into the commercialized LAMP platform through the following Aims: SA 1 (Phase I): Migrate
ORCATECH/CART system to secure and scalable cloud operability. SA 2 (Phase II): Optimization of LAMP for
data transfer, storage, and analysis. SA 3 (Phase II): Demonstrate LAMP usability with Alpha-testing with a
third party, off-site location."

for cancer detection and staging, particularly of primary and metastatic brain cancers. However, there are
concerns about the potential long-term toxicity of GBCAs. GBCAs cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF),
a devastating disorder that affects patients with kidney disease. FDA imposed a “black box” warning against
GBCA use in this population. This has a significant medical impact: 16% of US adults suffer from moderate or
severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), and this patient population is disproportionately afflicted with comorbidities
like cancer (where many chemotherapies are nephrotoxic). There is no alternative imaging for these patients.
Contrast enhanced CT can cause acute and irreversible kidney injury and is also contraindicated. All GBCAs
cause accumulation of Gd in the brain and bone, even in patients with normal kidney function. Gd is highly toxic
in its free form, and little is known about the toxicological implications of deposited Gd: concern is rising among
physicians, patients, and regulatory agencies. In 2017 the FDA announced a new class warning for all GBCAs.
The European Medicines Agency suspended the marketing authorizations for the 4 GBCAs that are associated
with the highest risk of Gd deposition, and arguably may have removed all GBCAs had there been a safe, Gd-
free alternative. Accumulation of Gd is particularly worrisome for cancer survivors and those at high risk for
cancer, e.g. BRCA positive women. They require regular GBCA-enhanced MRIs for surveillance or screening,
and may have dozens of MRIs through life. Avoiding GBCAs forces physicians to make key patient management
decisions with limited imaging information, while continued use may put these vulnerable patients at risk.Reveal Pharmaceuticals is developing the gadolinium-free MRI contrast agent, RVP-001, invented at
Massachusetts General Hospital. RVP-001 provides equivalent image contrast to commercial GBCAs in different
animal models. Manganese (Mn) injected as RVP-001 is more efficiently eliminated than Gd from an equal dose
of Gd-DOTA, which is considered the best in class GBCA for safety with respect to stability. Nonclinical studies
established a very high safety margin for RVP-001. A Phase 1 study to assess safety, tolerability, and
pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects demonstrated that RVP-001 is safe and well tolerated up to doses higher
than the anticipated clinical dose. This grant will support first in human MR imaging studies. We will perform a
dose range finding study in patients with GBCA-enhancing central nervous system lesions, e.g. brain cancers,
to assess imaging efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and safety. We will assess the degree of RVP-001 lesion
enhancement compared to unenhanced MRI and compared to the patient’s GBCA enhanced MRI. The goal of
the study is to establish an effective dose for further clinical development and approval.This grant application is predicated on the Fast Track NIH grant award R44 DK113906-03 and is a

healthcare system over $20 billion annually. Many DFUs fail to heal effectively and require
extensive medical intervention. Nearly 50% of DFUs worsen to “tunnel” into deep tissues
involving tendons and bones (DTU-DFUs). When this happens, DFUs are susceptible to severe
complications like infection, which significantly increases cost of treatment and the risk of lower
limb amputation and death.The current treatment for DTU-DFUs is expensive, time consuming, complicated, and
involves the sequential and cyclical application of multiple products. Antimicrobial management
is always the first step in wound care, as failure to keep a wound free of infection limits healing.
Despite the many antimicrobial products available, outcomes remain unsatisfactory.Gel4Med has developed G4Derm, a biosynthetic flowable wound care product designed
to address complex DTU-DFUs. G4Derm has already demonstrated efficacy and safety in
preclinical studies. The final product is a flowable scaffolding matrix provided as a shelf-stable,
ready, and easy-to-use syringe with an applicator tip. The flowable form factor allows G4Derm
to completely fill cavities of complex tunneling wounds. Once applied, the hydrogel resolves into
a scaffolding matrix with mammalian cell attachment sites to facility tissue regeneration. The
patented composition of G4Derm is uniquely and inherently antimicrobial – the gel disrupts
bacterial membranes on contact. In combination, these characteristics make G4Derm a highly
useful product to address the dire unmet need of DTU-DFUs.The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, and feasibility of
G4Derm in an early-phase, pilot clinical study for patients with refractory DTU-DFUs. This
clinical evaluation is key to making G4Derm available to patients with DTU wounds. Gel4Med
will collect data on wound healing, tissue regeneration, quality of life, and risk of infection. After
the treatment period, patients will be able to participate in a 6-month follow-up period to assess
the risk of recurrence and durability of wound closure.The completion of this pilot clinical study is a key step to bringing G4Derm, which
combines enhanced wound healing with microbial management, to patients with treatment-
resistant DTU-DFUs and represents a paradigm shift in the treatment complex chronic wounds."

Models have predicted that an H7N9 pandemic could result in infection of one third of the world population and death of ~40% of those infected, making it the deadliest virus in recorded history (the 1918 flu had a fatality rate of ~2.5%). There is currently no approved therapeutic for severe influenza infection, and in the case of H7N9 ~98% of those infected develop severe infection and require hospitalization. This project seeks to provide some hope of protection in such an outbreak by advancing the most effective broad-spectrum human antibody therapeutic currently available, CM-IAV1. CM-IAV1 has great promise since it has already been shown to protect mice against lethal (non-laboratory strain) H7N9 and H5N1 when given in a single dose 72 hours post-infection. We have assembled a world-class team with outstanding preclinical data and are now focused on advancing CM-IAV1 into the clinic. The experiments presented in this application will take a promising laboratory product and, together with our continued and parallel investments, create a clinical asset with enormous potential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated influenza infection from the most relevant CDC- prioritized pandemic strains. We believe that development of this antibody, at this time, and by this team represents the best hope of offering meaningful lifesaving protection against the terrifying possibility of a global Influenza A outbreak.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) transmission from mother to fetus is implicated in ~15% of stillbirths and
~16,000 birth defects annually in the US. HCMV is also the major viral cause of medical complications associated
with bone marrow and organ transplantation. Passive immunization using anti-HCMV enriched human immune
globulin (HIG) has shown promising activity for both indications. HIG is a complex, variable product that may
cause side effects from off-target antibody binding. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) offers qualitative advantages
over HIG including potency, safety, production efficiency and quality control. Trellis Bioscience has discovered
a high affinity native human mAb (TRL345) against the most conserved site on the HCMV virion (gB AD-2 Site
I). TRL345 is a human IgG1kappa (G1m1,17 (z,a); Km3 allotype) monoclonal antibody cloned from human B
lymphocytes. This mAb neutralized 15 out of 15 clinical isolates of all four major serotypes. It protected all of the
specialized cell types relevant to human pathology. It was also fully protective in a model of human placental
fragments grown as tissue explants ex vivo. This published work was completed under a Phase I/II SBIR grant.
A Master Cell Bank has been developed that expresses TRL345 in CHO cells at a commercially useful level
(1.74 g/L) at the 250L GMP scale. All IND-enabling analytical work has been completed, including GLP toxicology
in rats and tissue reactivity profiling. With SBIR CRP funding, the first clinical lot has been manufactured yielding
sufficient material for Phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials. We propose here to conduct a Phase 1 single

Reia is working to address a prevalent gynecological condition, pelvic organ prolapse (POP), which
affects more than 50% of women over the age of 50. POP occurs when the pelvic floor connective
tissue and muscles weaken, allowing the uterus or vaginal walls to descend. In extreme cases, the
uterus descends through the opening of the vagina and hangs outside of the body. POP can be treated
non-surgically with a pessary that is inserted into the vagina and acts as a shelf to support the
descending organs. Commonly used pessaries have a fixed and rigid design, making them difficult or
impossible for patients to remove and insert independently. Reia has developed an innovative
collapsible pessary to reduce pain and discomfort associated with pessary insertion and removal.
During Phase II, the pessary successfully passed all FDA required mechanical, microbiological, and
biocompatibility tests. Reia has evaluated its pessary in n=50 current pessary users between its early
feasibility and feasibility trials. Subjects reported increased comfort during insertion and removal when
using Reia’s pessary compared to their current pessaries and their prolapse was effectively supported.
During Phase IIB, Reia will (1) prepare and submit a 510(k) clearance application to the FDA. Reia will
achieve this aim by professionally manufacturing and testing fitting pessaries, performing packaging,
shipping, and distribution testing, and compiling the 510(k) application. Reia will (2) modify and optimize
a pessary applicator, which was designed during Phase II to increase access to self-management. To
achieve this aim, Reia will professionally manufacture a ß-prototype with medical grade materials,
perform benchtop mechanical, biocompatibility, and cleaning validation testing, and assemble a 510(k)
application. Reia will (3) conduct a clinical trial comparing success of home-management between
Reia’s pessary system (pessary and applicator) and the standard of care in pessary-naïve patients.
Defined evaluation criteria have been established to measure progress and success.
Reia’s founding team is comprised of a urogynecologist with 25 years of experience fitting pessaries
and treating POP and a 3-person, female executive management team with combined experience in
product development, operational manufacturing and production practices, and IP advisory.
Additionally, an advisory board contributes expertise in urogynecology, commercialization of medical
devices, and successful completion of numerous NIH grant funded projects. Reia has strategically
aligned with manufacturing facilities, testing laboratories, and regulatory consultants to gain access to
necessary equipment, resources, and guidance to successfully complete this project.
Reia is committed to optimizing its pessary system for clinical use and manufacture to bring to market
the first-ever pessary specifically designed to address women’s needs."

Bloomer Tech is advancing development of the Bloomer Augmented Garment Platform, a wearable bra with
embedded sensors to address cardiovascular healthcare disparities in women. Cardiovascular disease is the
leading cause of death in women, resulting in nearly 315,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2020, where women generally
experience worse outcomes than men including increased disability, hospitalization, and earlier mortality.
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is strongly recommended by the American Heart Association and the American
College of Cardiology for a variety of indications based on evidence for reduced mortality and morbidity and
increased quality of life. Unfortunately, only ~15% to 20% of eligible women participate in this life saving program,
compared to 22% to 30% of men. Critically, barriers to participation may differ between women and men and
different interventions may therefore be required to increase adherence. Research suggests that supporting
women through expanded access to safe, remote access of CR-related exercise routines holds significant
potential to improve adherence and broadly improve cardiovascular outcomes in women. Specifically for women,
there is an opportunity to increase adherence by catalyzing their motivation and increasing frequency of
reinforcing conditions that provide reassurance, supervision, and validation to her achievements in the program
and support her adherence within the care continuum. A continuous remote sensing platform that women felt
safe and comfortable in holds significant potential to promote adoption and adherence to CR. To address this
need, Bloomer Tech has developed the Bloomer Augmented Garment Platform, a female bra with embedded
textile sensors that are washable and designed specifically for collecting cardiac biomarker information from
women. Bloomer Tech has demonstrated Phase I equivalent proof-of-concept by creating an MVP software
platform, establishing device manufacturing best practices, and demonstrating reproducible sensor signal quality
in a variety of different bra sizes necessary for continuous monitoring. The goal of this project will be to
demonstrate that the Bloomer Tech Platform increases adherence to CR compared to the current standard of
care through a robust randomized clinical trial in women prescribed CR at the University of Florida Medical
Center and Lakeland Regional Health in Florida. Furthermore, the trial will assess overall participant perception
of safety and comfort using the Bloomer Tech bra. Success with these goals will support commercial adoption
by both clinicians and patients by demonstrating that patients can safely and comfortably participate in CR both
in the clinic and during at-home exercises that are not directly supervised by a clinician."

Couplet Care, LLC is developing the Couplet Care BassinetTM, a novel infant clinical bassinet designed to support
safe implementation of skin-to-skin contact and rooming-in on postnatal units. Until recently, the standard of
hospital care for healthy term newborns was to be observed and cared for by maternity staff in a nursery with
other infants. However, as detailed in the World Health Organization/UNICEF report Ten Steps for Successful
Breastfeeding, it is now recommended that mothers and infants “room-in” together 24 hours per day, with one
hour of separation allowable for procedures outside of the postnatal unit room. As a result, the practice of nursery
care is no longer recommended nor facilitated. However, most bassinets in U.S. hospitals are still designed for
use by ambulatory nursery staff, rather than by mobility-impaired new mothers. These relics of nursery care
restrict maternal access to their infants and introduce infants to increased risk of physical injury. Bassinet tubs
can tip under the weight of mothers’ arms and the height of the tub walls can compromise infant handling. Often,
new mothers are required to either substantially twist their bodies to access their infants or get up out of bed to
reach them, despite being in immediate postpartum period and needing to heal. Such actions can cause new
mothers to experience unnecessary frustration, pain, or even injury. This is especially critical to the one-third of
U.S. women who deliver by cesarean section, as their limited ability to move and postpartum pain hinder timely
and safe infant care, undermine breastfeeding, impede their own recovery, and contribute to risk of infant falls
and suffocation. The substantial difficulty maneuvering infants in and out of conventional bassinets, coupled with
the pain and fatigue felt by new mothers, increase the risk of 1) infant drops, and 2) falling asleep with infants in
unsafe arrangements. To address these gaps in safe care, Couplet Care has developed a novel bassinet that
allows mothers to position infants over their bed and handle the infants independently. This is the only bassinet
model that gives mothers 100% access to their infant, without requiring the assistance of a second
person for infant transfer or bassinet adjustment. To ensure usability and safety, the Couplet Care Bassinet
design incorporates (1) a lower tub wall with access points, making it easier for a mother to reach her infant, (2)
adjustability features that allow for bassinet positioning over the mother, and (3) a design that secures the tub
into the frame. Building on the learnings from prototype use in a clinical setting during Phase I, Couplet Care
proposes the following Phase II Specific Aims: 1) Design Couplet Care Bassinet that is manufacturable and
compliant with FDA regulations, 2) Evaluate the impact of the Couplet Care Bassinet on maternal-infant patient
outcomes in a powered RCT, 3) Evaluate the usability and adoptability of the device from clinician and user
perspectives. This effort will give rise to a commercially viable bassinet that promotes safe mother-infant
connection during rooming-in while reducing the risk of infant drops/falls and suffocation, maternal waking from
unmet infant needs, and demands on nurses for assistance with non-medical needs."

However, the application of the7 Accelerated Crucible Rotation Technique (ACRT) growth method developed at WSU has proven to8 produce industrial quality, high-performance CdTe/CZT. This recently developed growth method not only9 allows CdTe/CZT to be grown with the same quality as material grown by THM, but also at growth rates
10 approximately 10-20 times faster than THM. Specifically, CdTe/CZT is grown by THM at a rate of
11 approximately 1-3 mm per day, whereas CdTe/CZT growth by ACRT can be accomplished at much faster
12 rates of approximately 1-3 mm per hour. THM-grown CdTe/CZT requires a lower growth temperature for
13 high-quality devices, which results in highly off-stoichiometric melts, thereby inducing the need for
14 postprocessing. These major challenges associated with the crystal growth of CdTe/CZT have been
15 overcome using ACRT. It is proposed here to further develop the ACRT growth process by introducing
16 crystal seeding in the ACRT system for CdTe and scale this process to commercial-grade levels while
17 continuing to improve the CdTe device properties for high-flux SPECT/CT applications. Chlorine doping
18 will be further explored and optimized to achieve high resistivity and high mobility-lifetime CdTe devices.
19 Numerous CdTe:Cl ingots will be grown, and devices will be produced from these ingots (cross strip and
20 commercial pixel patterns). Devices will be sent to commercial partners and customers for validation in
21 effort to integrate into commercial imaging systems. A prototype SPECT/CT system will be designed, built,

23 2025. Stakeholders in the medical imaging market need CdTe/CZT devices now. The fruition of this project
24 will be a significant reduction (rt3x) of industrial-grade material costs by increasing the yield, reducing the
25 growth time, and eliminating post-growth anneal treatments currently used by industry. With the fast-
26 production time and high-performance of the CdTe/CZT produced in this effort, (1) the medical imaging
27 market will finally have a fast turnaround time and consistent high-performance material that can easily be
28 obtained, (2) a rt3x price reduction is projected for CdTe/CZT, and (3) Stakeholders will have access to an
29 affordable, high-performance CdTe/CZT material that can be obtained for imaging instrumentation and
30 other radiation detection applications."

For about 175,000 leg and hip fractures each year, the best treatment is for an orthopaedic surgeon to implant
a stiff metal rod, or intramedullary (IM) nail, through the center of the bone and fix the nail to the bone with screws
(distal locking). Distal locking can be difficult and time-consuming step and presents two major challenges. First,
the procedure uses C-arm fluoroscopy for guidance and exposes surgeons to radiation. For surgeons with high
case volumes (Level 1 and 2 trauma centers), this results in higher rates of radiation exposure. Recent studies
have demonstrated that the commonly held notion that exposure is negligible is misleading and most orthopaedic
surgeons are inadequately protected. Second, the procedure requires a high rate of precision to avoid less than
ideal patient outcomes, such as limb malrotation. Orthopaedic generalists experience alignment challenges more
often due to smaller case volumes. Difficulty during this procedure also affects patients with longer surgery times,
additional blood loss and increased radiation exposure. A faster and safer method is needed to reduce radiation
exposure and improve patient outcomes. Eclipse Orthopaedics (EO) is a startup focused on improving internal
fixation procedures. Based on patented technology, Eclipse Orthopaedics is developing a freehand targeting
device, the Radiographic Targeting Attachment™ (RTA) that puts both targeting and drilling capabilities literally
in the surgeons’ hands. The RTA combines a small X-ray source and a drill attachment that, when paired with
the imager and drill, becomes a fluoroscopically-guided drill that locates and drills holes in one operation. EO is
currently developing this technology while pursuing a licensing agreement with a major trauma supplier, who will
market the RTA as an integral part of their internal fixation product portfolio. Building off of extensive preliminary
data as well as customer knowledge gained through over 100 customer interviews during I-Corps and an NIH
Niche Assessment, the goal of this Direct to Phase II is to complete a multi-site study among a wide range of
orthopaedic surgeons. The Direct to Phase II project has been designed in response to the FDA’s medical device
design control guidance document. Specific Aims are as follows: (Aim 1) Design, build and verify prototype,
which will reduce the radiation dose to less than half the standard method. (Aim 2) Verify effectiveness and
usability in a multi-site cadaver study. (Aim 3) Begin design control, define regulatory pathway, and improve the
RTA system. At the conclusion of the Direct to Phase II, Eclipse Orthopaedics will have the key system
performance data, human factors insights from evaluations of target users, and a well-defined regulatory path.
Eclipse will plan a comprehensive product development schedule in Phase IIB. EO is located in Warsaw, Indiana,
an epicenter of orthopaedic innovation and industry. Leveraging its industry relationships, EO will continue to
explore the already high interest in licensing from leading orthopedic device manufacturers."

mechanical functions of the nurse at the dosing window. Specifically, these mechanical functions include bottle
positioning, capping, labeling, and placing for patient. This would allow nurses to use their clinical skills,
serving patients across vast geographic regions, and only using a robot to physically dispense the medication
directly to a patient. Technology and automation will create a resilient and agile business model for opioid
treatment programs (OTPs), allowing a contactless patient-nurse experience and a centralized dosing queue
which allows clinics to share the dosing window workload across OTP clinics. The Drug Enforcement Agency
(DEA) regulates activities and medication storage at OTPs. That is why our first, and most critical, milestone is
to design, build, and compliance test a custom safe that meets our technical needs as well as 21 CFR

the hardware. After DEA approval, we will develop the software architecture and design, and prototype the
end-to-end robotic process from pumping into a bottle, capping, labeling, and placing bottle in a specified

The ROM SHARC design will support Mine Countermeasure Forces, Lethal Long-Range Unmanned Systems, as well as Forward Force Maneuver and Posture Resilience. The catamaran will additionally have ballistic and electro-magnetic interference (EMI) protection available for critical components, such as engine and control system. Full Naval integration is a key design element.

For Phase II, ROM Development Corporation proposes to build a full-scale and operational 40’ Catamaran with twin 300 hp outboard diesel engines and basic level of autonomy in Phase II Base with a higher level of autonomy with a Phase II Option.  The craft will be capable of carrying the 14,000 lb. EMAV and other payload at 25 knots in sea state 2 and 20 knots in Sea State 3 at 80% MCR and have enough fuel to support the 200 NM range requirement.   The SHARC has been designed to allow both a bow and stern ramp enabling both bow and stern loading/off-loading as well as the potential to create a bridge to the beach/dock.  For transportability, the ROM SHARC complies with all road transportation requirements of the continental United States.  The craft will meet or exceed the requirements stated by the US Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) Statement of work and technical specifications. The stability and payload capability of ROM’s SHARC catamaran design is proven and cost effective to build large unit volumes. Using ROM’s knowledge of both specialty craft and production boat-building brings unique volume, low-cost and capability knowledge to the US Marines. With long-term, low-cost, and high-volume production in mind the design and engineering will be driven by manufacturing cost effectiveness. We will design to plug-and-play autonomous sensors and computers, as the technology is rapidly evolving and will need continuous upgrades.

In one machine, suspect items, devices and supplies can be chemically sterilized to a high degree of confidence in a process that is so rapid as to be practical and easy. The Phase I completed prototype successfully achieved 0% recoverable bacterial spores in 10 minutes (greater than 6-log reduction) when those spores were located on the distal (furthest) portion of the internal instrument channel of a simulated surgical scope. The technical challenges in delivering the Topic's desired specifications and performance were achieved for Phase I. Further refinements are planned in Phase II work plans including optimized design and treatment cycles as well as all safety and regulatory and GLP studies which will be included in the final FDA 510(k) clearance application. PURioLABS believes the PURitALL Desktop can be field-ready within 24 months. According to the CDC: In the United States, approximately 46.5 million surgical procedures including approximately 5 million gastrointestinal endoscopies—are performed each year. Each procedure involves contact by a medical device or surgical instrument with a patient’s sterile tissue or mucous membranes. A major risk of all such procedures is the introduction of pathogens that can lead to infection. Of the approximately two million American patients who acquire an HAI (Healthcare Associated Infection) annually, an estimated 90,000 will die. The average cost of a single case is over $25,000, with the direct cost of HAIs to hospitals estimated at between $28 billion and $45 billion annually. For the warfighter and the supporting forward medical units, lower infection risk equals higher average readiness. For the battlefield and civilian opportunities to lower infection rates, the PURitALL Desktop features an innovative, fast, eco-friendly multi-modal antimicrobial technology that is applied to the exterior surfaces and interior channels of medical devices and supplies. The original core technology has proven efficacy via independent laboratories, is recently deployed as a mobile cabinet in hospital pilots and is acknowledged by leading U.S. epidemiologists as very promising. Our Phase I PURitALL Desktop has further advanced the core technology to provide mobile and rugged sterilization capability with nominal power requirements, a lighter construction, flexible interior space for a variety of devices while not leaving behind harsh chemicals, solid waste or environmental impact. Treated devices are relieved of living bioburden, are dried to touch, have no treatment residue, with no device damage, at a very low cost of operation."

This proposal is submitted in direct response to NOT-HD-22-009 Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Innovative
Technologies to Improve Assessments, Interventions, and Outcomes for Individuals with Intellectual and
Developmental Disabilities [IDD] (R43/R44). Persons of all ages with certain metabolic disorders are at-risk for
metabolic crises when a certain metabolite accumulates, while this metabolite can be measured in a clinical
laboratory, currently there is no home-based device to monitor the metabolie that causes the metabolic crises.Our team’s long-term goal is to reduce the morbidity and mortality of metabolic crises associated with
certain metabolic accumulation. Through previous and ongoing National Science Foundation and National
Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research funding, we have developed an at-home device to
accurately measure this metabolite from a drop of blood and are working towards FDA clearance. The overall
objective of this proposal is to investigate the impact of daily home-based monitoring of the target metabolite
using the device we developed. This will be the first time that at-home measurement of the metabolite will be
measured in the target population at home.Our central hypothesis is that when participants measure at-home, fasting, morning metabolite levels
there will be an association between getting an elevated metabolite result and then the patient taking further
action to contacting their medical team to further monitor or take steps to reduce the metabolite level.Our specific aims are 1) to perform a clinical trial in 10 participants with disorders resulting in risk of
elevated metabolite levels, 2) to analyze the extensive data collected, and 3) to prepare a manuscript of the
results. To complete our approach we will recruit patients from the available patient population at Oregon
Health and Science University. We will collect extensive data from the participant medical record, observations,
and the device daily metabolite measurements.This research is innovative because, for the first time, it provides a straightforward, home-based device
for measurement of the target metabolite. At the conclusion of this project, we expect to understand more the
impact of home-based metabolite monitoring on patient care."

Snakebite envenoming poses a global risk to human health. For over 125 years, antivenoms have consisted of
animal-derived polyclonal serum immunoglobulin G (IgG). In recent decades, IgG digested into antigen-binding
fragments Fab(2) has been found to reduce some of the most severe side-effects of non-human antivenom.
These antivenoms are obtained by immunizing horses or sheep with individual snake venom, in order to produce
a product that is effective only against those specific snake species. There are currently over 40 antivenom
products against individual snake species, and these treatments all present several challenges, including early-
onset adverse reactions to animal plasma derived antivenoms, shortened half-life, need for repeated intravenous
(IV) infusion by medical personnel, and correct identification of the specific snake. In contrast, human
recombinant broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) capable of recognizing shared toxins found across all snake
venoms would enable the production of a single broad-spectrum product to treat all snakebite. Human IgG bnAbs
would avoid the serum sickness and anaphylaxis risk inherent to non-human antivenom, making possible safe
use of intramuscular (IM) delivery and field deployment of a full IgG product with a 3-week half-life. We will extend
our work from the Phase I, where fully-human, bnAbs identified from a unique antibody repertoire were
characterized and validated to have broad in vivo efficacy. Now, Centivax will complete the discovery of bnAbs
against the remaining key toxins common to all snake venom, for the development of VenPen, a broad-spectrum,
thermostabilized, lyophilized, fully human-derived antivenom, with reduced need for refrigeration or training and
capable of IM delivery a field-deployable dual-chamber injector. Uniquely, these antibodies were isolated from a
unique hyper-immune subject whose immune system has developed broadly neutralizing, highly-specialized
anti-snake venom antibodies through a history of documented escalating dose self-immunizations over 17+
years with diverse snake venoms. Centivax is well on the way to developing VenPen universal antivenom, with
one broadly-neutralizing in vivo protective antibody to long-neurotoxins already developed and bnAbs to the
other four most dangerous toxins in various stages of development. Aim 1: Complete the development of the
elapid cocktail by identifying bnAbs against the remaining dominant toxins in the Elapidae snake family and
demonstrate protection in vivo against whole venom of diverse elapid snake genera of medical consequence.
Aim 2: Complete the development of identifying bnAbs against dominant toxins in the Viperidae family, and
characterize the protection in vivo against diverse genera of viperids of medical consequence. Aim 3: Combine
and formulate the final VenPen bnAb cocktail for lyophilization for use in both IV vials as well as rapid IM delivery
dual chamber auto-injector. The potential benefits and applications of a thermostabilized, broadly neutralizing
anti-venom are far reaching including maximizing protection of all Americans exposed to snakebite, U.S. military
personnel deployed both nationally and abroad, and rural communities worldwide."

remaining lifetime. Fragility hip fracture is one of the most serious and debilitating outcomes of osteoporosis with
a 20–40% mortality rate during the first year after the fracture. Hip fracture incidence rates are known to increase
exponentially with age in both women and men; and with the rising life expectancy throughout the globe, the
number of men and women who will be above the threshold of fragility fracture is expected to almost double,
with a prediction of 319 million cases by 2040. Thus, the number of fractures is predicted to double as well.In this Direct Phase II SBIR, BioSensics, in collaboration with orthopaedic, radiology, endocrinology and
biomechanics experts at Harvard Medical School, proposes to develop a cloud-based software solution for
automatic, opportunistic screening for hip fracture risk using plain X-ray images, called XFx. X-ray studies are
ubiquitous in all corners of the world, are inexpensive and provide high resolution studies that offer insight into
bone geometry, microstructure and density, at a low ionizing radiation dose. The proposed software solution will
include 1) a desktop application for uploading X-ray images and displaying and visualizing XFx results, and 2) a
secure cloud-based backend for receiving the uploaded X-ray images and performing the analysis. The software
architecture will support on-premise integration with a hospital cloud services (e.g., PACS systems) to enable
automatic, opportunistic screening for hip fracture risk using plain X-ray images. The solution will stand by in the
central imaging data server of hospitals or clinics, investigate each non-investigated X-ray image, and if
recognized to include a proximal femur, automatically execute the AI/ML-based classification scheme to identify
patients with osteoporosis or at high risk of hip fracture. If a patient is identified to have osteoporosis or a high
risk of fracture, the software will flag the patient. The clinician providing care for the patient will then be prompted
to consider ordering an evaluation of fragility fracture risk and receive a full report.This process is reimbursable under the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 76499 “Unlisted
Diagnostic Radiographic Procedure.” This code is used when no other specific procedure code exists. The
existence of this CPT will support the initial marketing of the proposed solution. In Phase III, we will prepare an
application for a new Category III CPT code and submit if for consideration by the American Medical Association
(AMA) CPT Editorial Panel. Given the clinical need of the proposed solution, and recent approval of a CPT code
for radiology artificial intelligence (code 0691T) for automated analysis of existing imaging studies for vertebral
fracture and bone density assessment, our application for a new CPT code should not face any difficulties. In
the longer term, the proposed imaging analysis technology can be used for automatic analysis of thousands of
medical images that are taken every day in hospitals and clinics. This will enable detection of diseases and
conditions at early stages (e.g., bone metastasis and different tumors), thus facilitating preventive measures and
better care for those individuals at risk."

Work under this proposal supports development of a broad-spectrum point-of-care (POC) coagulometer by
Perosphere Technologies (The Perosphere Technologies POC Coagulometer) with the intent to create and offer
an automated, microfluidic version of the manual Lee/White clotting time method. The device is based on novel
technology and utilizes reagent-less, single-use microfluidic cuvettes made of silicon and glass for measurement
of blood samples. Clot activation occurs at the beginning of the intrinsic clotting pathway through contact of a
blood sample with the inner glass and silicon surfaces of the cuvette. The device detects clot formation by
monitoring the intensity of near-infrared light, transmitted through cuvette and blood sample, and sensing of fibrin
assembly at the end of the common clotting pathway. The clot detection scheme affords development of two
main assays, a Clotting Time Assay, that measures the time to onset of clot formation and is currently
implemented on the coagulometer platform, and a Clot Lysis Time assay, that measures the time to onset of
subsequent clot breakdown and is in development. Research indicates that the device is broadly sensitive to
the effects of anticoagulants across drug class, their reversal agents and thrombolytic drugs. Initial marketing
efforts will focus on use of the device with implemented Clotting Time assay for monitoring of the direct oral
anticoagulants (DOACs) and low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). Research under this proposal targets
establishment of clotting time reference ranges for healthy volunteers and patients on the DOACs rivaroxaban,
apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban, in direct support of initial marketing goals. In support of future device
applications, the research also targets assessment of the device’s ability to detect inherited or acquired
coagulopathies, based on abnormal clotting times, as well as assessment of the device’s sensitivity to
abelacimab, a novel anticoagulant and direct factor XI/XIa inhibitor, currently in clinical development.
Perosphere Technologies intends to commercialize the device through a marketing, sales and distribution
partnership with a global medical device company. The device is similarly suited for use in emergency situations
(e.g. emergency room, emergency vehicle) and for routine care in the inpatient and outpatient settings (hospitals,
clinics, surgical suites, doctor’s offices, pharmacies) by healthcare professionals who can perform or order fresh
venous whole blood draws. The device promises to address several unmet medical needs, including point-of-
care monitoring of DOACs, and has the potential to define new standards of care. The device is expected to
improve patient care, clinical outcome and to reduce healthcare costs, by providing physicians with the means
to make faster and better-informed treatment decisions. The developed Clotting Time and Clot Lysis Time
assays will present a new way to describe a patient’s coagulation state and enable opportunities for fundamental
research of disease mechanisms and therapeutic approaches."

This Fast-track SBIR application will fund and enable a new approach to respiratory monitoring, continuous
predictive respiratory monitoring (CPRM), that stands to reduce morbidity and mortality due to respiratory
compromise, while reducing health care system costs. Current devices and systems (human and machine) for
respiratory monitoring are responsive by sounding a warning alarm when a patient reaches a threshold of a
physiologic parameter (i.e. SpO2, ETCO2) and the patient is currently or has been in distress. Technological
limitations have prevented the field from moving further in its ability to predict patient decline so that health
care providers (HCPs) are able to intervene and stop or correct respiratory decline. Linshom has developed a
simple, inexpensive solution for continuous monitoring of respiratory functions including RR, TV, MV, I:E ratio,
and apnea detection. Linshom's 510k FDA-cleared Continuous Predictive Respiratory Sensor (CPRS) solves
existing unmet needs mentioned above with a small, portable, and inexpensive sensor and monitor that tracks
RR, TV, MV, seconds since last breath (SSLB), and I:E ratio in real time. These parameters are crucial for
monitoring of patients suffering from both acute and chronic respiratory illness. Unlike other respiratory
monitoring technologies, Linshom offers an operating room-quality respiratory profile at the patient bedside,
which allows health care providers to promptly diagnose emerging respiratory decline and intervene with
appropriate medical care. Timely intervention should reduce morbidity and mortality and result in significantly
improved care for the patient and large savings for the health care system via reduction in rapid response
activation and ICU transfers. Linshom’s unique ability to provide TV (and thus MV) in the non-intubated patient
creates a profile of patient respiratory status previously not available outside of the OR or ICU (and only in
intubated patients).
In this Fasttrack SBIR we will i) Generate clinical data proving Linshom CPRM’s ability to detect (predict) a
respiratory depression episode (RDE) before current standard of care and devices, ii.) Determine optimal times
to set early warning alarms (maximizing sensitivity and specificity) such that HCPs can intervene sooner than
current practice and avoid morbidity and mortality due to respiratory failure, and iv.) Redesign the CPRS into a
miniaturized chip based device enabling the Linshom CPRM to reach more patients by enabling nasal cannula
(and eventually a home monitor) integration."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, has traditionally been defined by the
accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in neuritic plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles.
However, recent evidence indicates that AD is better viewed as a continuum of disease with a broader degree
of mechanistic and pathological heterogeneity. For example, ~15% of AD patients are negative for Aβ and most
AD patients have “mixed pathology”, with large subsets exhibiting accumulation of additional neurodegenerative
biomarkers such as α-synuclein (α-syn) and the TDP-43. Hippocampal and amygdalar deposits of TDP-43 have
recently been characterized as defining a disease state that overlaps heavily with AD: Limbic-predominant, Age-
related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE). At present, AD diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation of symptoms and
PET imaging of Aβ and Tau load. However, this is costly, involves exposure to radiation, and does not have the
ability to detect broader dimensions of AD heterogeneity, such as the presence of pathological α-syn and TDP-
43 deposits that define large subsets of the AD continuum. There is an unmet medical need for an antemortem
diagnostic that can reliably identify mechanistic heterogeneity in individual AD patients, ideally one that can
detect multiple disease-related biomarkers simultaneously and non-invasively in CNS tissue. Amydis is
leveraging the retina as a “window to the brain” to address this unmet need by developing an ocular contrast
agent – i.e. a “retinal tracer – that can be used to fluorescently label α-syn, TDP-43, and Aβ in patients suspected
of having AD. The retinal tracer, AMDX-2011P, currently in human clinical trials, has these remarkable
capabilities and is designed to have fluorescent properties amenable for use with standard retinal imaging
equipment found in the eye care office, making this technology widely accessible. In this proposal, Amydis will
take the first clinical steps towards developing transformative new diagnostic technology in AD focusing on the
biomarker Aβ in AD patient retinas. The specific aims of the project are: (1) to develop a lyophilized product of
AMDX-2011P for i.v. delivery; (2) to complete a Phase 1B clinical trial of AMDX-2011P in patients with a clinical
diagnosis of FAD (known FAD mutation and dementia) who have a positive Aβ PET scan (N=12), subjects with
known FAD mutation but without clinical evidence of dementia (N=12) and healthy subjects (N=8) to determine
if the tracer reliably reports on Aβ status; and, (3) to begin constructing a database of AD and normal retinal
images for use in developing automated, AI-assisted retinal biomarker analytics tools for physicians and
researchers. Completion of these aims will advance the development of our in vivo ocular diagnostic test, getting
us one step closer to our mission of providing an antemortem, simple, and affordable diagnostic to parse the
heterogeneity of AD. Future studies will integrate knowledge obtained from ongoing clinical studies of AMDX-
2011P as a marker of a-syn and TDP-43 and assess whether the tracer can report on the co-occurrence and
variability of these critical biomarkers in individual patients."

This grant is in response to PA-22-176, an omnibus call from NIH, FDA, and CDC. Therein the FDA expresses
the need to develop computer modelling tools that help with regulatory decision making.
Sterilization is the terminal step of medical device development, and sterilization validation is a regulatory re-
quirement. We are developing a Monte Carlo modelling tool that can produce virtual dose maps for radiation
sterilization, thereby helping medical companies make important decisions about sterilization that will also affect
the regulatory pathway early in the medical device development cycle. As modelling only requires a CAD model
of the device and not a manufactured device (which is required for dose mapping at a contract sterilizer), mod-
elling can be used early to iterate on the design of the device and its packing. Such a modelling tool will allow
medical device companies to shorten and de-risk the design process with respect to sterilization.
Monte Carlo modelling libraries such as Geant4 have the ability to accurately model radiation transport and dose
deposition. Because of this, Geant4 is widely used in high energy physics and radiation treatment, but so far it
is rarely used for radiation sterilization. The reason for this is the lack of user friendliness, which stems from its
flexible architecture and the slow simulation speeds. Furthermore, Geant4 does not provide the ability to load
full CAD models, and thus makes it rather cumbersome to model entire medical devices.
In Phase I of this FDA SBIR grant, we showed that Geant4 can be deployed in the cloud. We have developed a
prototype of a web user interface to configure simulations and to review modeled results. Our cloud tool can load
full CAD models and accurately reproduce measured dose maps. We showed a 100x increase of simulation
speed compared to a single computer due to seamless scaling in the cloud.
In Phase II we will build on our accomplishments of Phase I and extend this tool to be capable of modeling dose
maps from X-ray and gamma sterilization. We will develop parametric radiation source models that can be cali-
brated with qualification data provided by the contract sterilizer. We will refine our user interface and give the
user the ability to compare the different radiation sterilization technologies. We will also implement the ability to
model virtual dosimeters to facilitate direct comparison with measurements. In user studies we will show that the
tool is user-friendly and can be used to streamline decisions necessary for regulatory filings.
Our modelling tool will be geared towards engineers at medical device companies and does not require an
advanced background in software engineering or radiation physics. Rather, the engineer will be guided through
simple steps through the simulation process. The engineer can review the results in a user-friendly viewer and
determine the dose uniformity ratio. We anticipate that our tool will offer significant benefits to the medical device
development community."

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the most common infectious cause of death. LRTI affects patients
more often in ICUs, especially patients with mechanical ventilators. Early initiation of short-course antibiotic
therapy is the cornerstone in managing mechanically ventilated patients with LRTI. However, using the current
clinical criteria, a diagnosis of LRTI is typically not made until an infection in the lower respiratory tract is well
established. To address the current limitations, molecular diagnostic technologies such as polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-based multiplex assays have been developed. However, they cannot distinguish between
colonization and infection. Therefore, a more sophisticated diagnostic methodology is needed for LRTI
diagnosis and management. Human exhaled air has great potential to address the current limitations in
diagnosing LRTI. However, the lack of a suitable collection system for clinical use put a major barrier to
exploring the medical potential of using human exhaled air. To address these limitations, Zeteo Tech
renovated the capture mechanism and developed a novel collection system, BreathBiomicsTM, for
biomolecules for human breath analysis. Specifically, we demonstrated that BreathBiomicsTM could be
configured into mechanical ventilators for collecting biomolecules in the exhaled air from intubated patients in
intensive care units. Most importantly, by characterizing these biomolecules using mass spectrometry, we
identified truncated proteoforms, which are the products of activated proteases, and demonstrated that
truncated proteoforms had the diagnostic potential for LRTI in a pilot study. Considering this evidence, we
propose to determine whether truncated proteoforms in human exhaled air can be used as a noninvasive
method for LRTI diagnosis and early prediction of LRTI in mechanically ventilated patients. Our work would
largely assist decision-making for clinicians regarding antibiotic treatment and dramatically improve patients'
clinical outcomes by limiting antibiotic requirements and minimizing harmful exposure to unnecessary antibiotic
treatment."

Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) affects ~300,000 people in the US, with 11,000 new cases/year. After SCI, spinal reflex
function becomes abnormal, contributing to motor impairments and spasticity that affects 65-78% of people
with SCI. Thus, restoring the function of spinal reflex pathways is a major therapeutic goal. Current therapies
are only moderately successful; motor function often does not return to pre-injury levels.
Research led by Dr. Wolpaw at the National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies (NCAN) and Dr. Thompson
at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) has developed a novel noninvasive therapy that targets
beneficial change to specific spinal reflex pathways. The patient learns, through operant conditioning, to modify
the brain’s control over the pathway. This modified control gradually changes the pathway, and triggers favorable
plasticity in other pathways as well. In people with SCI, spinal reflex conditioning reduces spasticity, eliminates
limping, and increases walking speed. The benefits persist; and they are apparent to people in their daily lives.
Clinical translation of this powerful new therapy is now impractical because the reflex conditioning system is
complex and requires a highly-trained operator. To realize its therapeutic potential, reflex conditioning needs an
integrated hardware/software system that can be mastered quickly and used effectively by therapists. BioCircuit
Technologies has the essential hardware; NCAN and MUSC have the essential software and clinical expertise.
BioCircuit has a strong record in transforming complex technology into turnkey systems. Working together,
BioCircuit, NCAN, and MUSC propose to create a reflex conditioning system suitable for widespread clinical use.
Phase I - Aim 1 will integrate hardware to record EMG from multiple sites and stimulate the peripheral nerve
with software to control recording and stimulation and provide real-time visual feedback to the patient and
results to the therapist. This new system will combine BioCircuit’s recording/stimulation platform, NCAN’s
automated algorithms, and MUSC’s clinical methods. Through formal clinician usability tests, we will optimize
the system and confirm its robustness and usability. Aim 2 will establish the device compliance and regulatory
pathway based on FDA feedback, bring development under design and quality system control, ensure regulatory
compliance, and guide the Phase II clinical study and the pathway to a future FDA 510(k) submission.
Phase II - Aim 1 will validate the effectiveness of the new system in people with chronic incomplete SCI. We
expect that reflex conditioning with the new system will equal or exceed that of the old system. Aim 2 will assess
the impact of the new system on motor function, quality of life, and community participation. We expect that its
benefits will equal or exceed those of the old system. These studies will identify metrics for a large post-Phase II
study. Aim 3 will gather initial data on safety for an FDA 510(k) submission for use in SCI.
This project will produce a robust clinically practical reflex conditioning system that enables this noninvasive
new therapy to complement traditional therapies and enhance recovery for people with SCI and other disorders."

Approximately 600,000 people live with partial hand amputations in the United States, with an estimated 14,500
new cases occurring each year. Despite the advances in miniaturized electronics and motors, there has been
very little advancement in mechatronic prosthetic digits for this underserved patient population. In fact, to date,
there is only one myoelectric prosthetic option for patients with partial hand loss in the US. This option is fragile,
often limited to light-duty tasks, and is too large to use on most partial hand loss cases. Considering this, it is no
surprise that less than half of the individuals with partial hand absence are able to return to their previous
employment, and those who do must often make considerable changes to their work-related tasks.
Thus, there is a substantial need to deliver a robust, low-profile myoelectric prosthetic digit system. To address
this need, we have formed a collaborative development team that has successfully launched six devices, which
have been fit on over 3,300 patients with upper limb loss and has significant regulatory experience, having
received two 510(k) approvals and five CE marks for upper limb prosthetic devices. With this background,
through this Fast-Track SBIR application, our collaborative team will develop and launch the Point Powered
system: an advanced mechatronic prosthesis system for individuals with partial hand loss which includes 1)
robust Point Powered digits; 2) low profile EMG electrodes; 3) a multi-input controller; 4) an iPad-based user
interface and 5) a flexible battery-based power system. The Point Powered system will 1) have industry leading
strength and speed, 2) offer anatomical rotation and flexion around the patient’s metacarpophalangeal (MCP)
joint, 3) have three anatomically accurate joints and sizes small enough to accommodate over 90% of men and
women, and 4) be compatible with future sophisticated control strategies.
In Phase I, we will perform three main tasks: 1) complete working prototypes of the electromechanical Point
Powered digit, controller, electrodes, and user interface 2) perform iterative testing with a focus group of 5
patients and prosthetists and verify component-level functionality and 3) complete internal verification on the
Point Powered system. Successful completion of these tasks will gate the progress of the project to Phase II.
In Phase II, the Point Powered system will be evaluated in two aims. In the first aim, we will complete third-party
verification to ensure compliance with medical device standards and we will perform clinical validations in
preparation for our long-term clinical study. Once the verification and validation steps are complete, a clinical
trial will be conducted to evaluate the system in 10 participants with partial hand loss against their standard-of-
care treatment. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have established safety and efficacy of the devices
and will submit a 510(k) application for premarket clearance. It is our long-term goal that the Point Powered
system will achieve a high degree of clinical impact through empowerment of partial hand amputees."
"Anti-hIAPP for the preservation of pancreatic function in Type 2 Diabetes","CELDARA MEDICAL, LLC",HHS,NIH,SBIR,"Phase II",R44DK135154,4R44DK135154-02,"September 8, 2023","August 31, 2025",999432,2023,200,PA21-259,2021,"16 CAVENDISH CT",,LEBANON,NH,03766-1441,USA,15,http://www.celdaramedical.com,MMVKQXZUBMQ7,828763263,N,N,N,"JOANA M MURAD",,"(617) 320-8521",jm@celdaramedical.com,"JAKE  REDER",,"(617) 320-8521",jr@celdaramedical.com,,"  ",,,"Project Summary
According to the American Diabetes Association, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) affects at least 30 million
Americans and is a major unmet public health concern with an annual cost in the United States of over $300
billion dollars. Additionally, nearly 25% of the U.S. population is already considered prediabetic, or at high risk of
developing T2D. These individuals are characterized by poor glycemic control as a result of insulin resistance
combined with reduced insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulation. At the prediabetic or early diabetic
stages, insulin insufficiency is frequently managed by medications that stimulate pancreatic secretion, which is
accompanied by increased levels of human islet amyloid polypeptide, hIAPP (amylin). Native hIAPP in its
monomeric form is a hormone that inhibits glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying, and acts as a satiety
agent. However, when hIAPP misfolds, which is common at elevated production, it results in structures called
protofibrils. These protofibrils are soluble, highly toxic, and capable of inducing cell death. The stimulated co-
secretion of hIAPP with insulin leads to a pathologic cycle of increased hIAPP, including misfolded hIAPP, that
leads to β cell toxicity in prediabetics and diabetics. The ensuing deficits in β cell function drive an increased
need for insulin secretion, which is accompanied by further hIAPP secretion. In this sense, T2D is an amyloid-
induced disease as evidenced by the presence of hIAPP plaque deposits in the pancreata of more than 90% of
T2D patients. Developing new therapeutic strategies that target toxic hIAPP protofibrils, inhibit their deposition
as toxic amylin fibrils, and ultimately preserve β cell health is a priority for addressing this major unmet need in
T2D.
Current standard-of-care in T2D is able to provide some control of blood glucose levels, but it fails to address
the  cell decline and its contribution to T2D progression. In this application we propose to advance a novel
therapeutic platform and our lead product from that platform, CM-TS1. CM-TS1 is a monoclonal antibody that
specifically targets protofibrils, soluble conformations of hIAPP for rapid clearance prior to plaque deposition and
 cell destruction. We have already demonstrated that CM-TS1 is capable of binding to these soluble protofibrils
in peripheral blood and in the pancreata of a T2D murine model. We will continue therapeutic development by
first validating our initial finding by demonstrating that CM-TS1 can clear hIAPP in an industry standard preclinical
model leading to a reduction of T2D pathology. Following this in vivo proof-of-concept, we will then advance CM-
TS1 through humanization and into early preclinical development including manufacturability, stable cell line
construction, and non-GLP pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies ultimately culminating in a pre-IND Type B
meeting with the FDA. The milestone of ultimate success will be launching this promising product into future
IND-enabling studies in order to successfully reach the patients that need it the most."

The goal of this project is to develop a new ureadepsipeptide antibiotic (UDEP) to treat infections caused by
Gram-positive pathogens, such as bacteremia, pneumonia, endocarditis, and prosthetic joint infections. UDEPs
have a unique mechanism of action – they kill bacteria by causing cells to digest their own proteins. This
mechanism enables activity against non-growing and dormant cells of bacteria that traditional antibiotics cannot
kill. Thus, UDEPs have the potential to fill a large and unmet medical need for biofilm-related and difficult to treat
infections. UDEP target what the CDC classifies as serious and concerning drug-resistant threats including
Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Drug-
Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Vancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Erythromycin-Resistant

Approximately 80% of patients beginning hemodialysis (HD) in the United States use a catheter at treatment
initiation, and 18.6% of all HD patients were using a catheter in 2017. However, the HD catheters (HDC) used
for longer-term dialysis in patients have a high complication rate because of infections and dysfunction, with a
catheter dysfunction rate of 0.5–3.42 episodes/1000 catheter-days. The most common catheter-related
problems are infections (catheter-related bloodstream infections; CRBSI) and thrombosis. Fibrin sheath
formation has a close relationship with pathogen colonization and biofilm formation on the catheter surface.
The entry of pathogens into the bloodstream through the catheter-extraluminal and intraluminal routes and the
seeding of pathogens that develop biofilm on the catheter surface cause CRBSI. In the US, annual HD
treatment costs ~$89,000 per patient, with total costs of $42 billion. In 2016, 80% of patients used a catheter at
initiation of HD and 18.6% of all HD patients in the US were using a catheter in 2017. However, no available
solutions to prevent catheter dysfunction can successfully prevent both thrombosis and infection.
FFMD is aiming to optimize and commercialize tethered liquid perfluorocarbon (TLP) coatings on medical
devices. Our TLP coating stops the adhesion of all biological components (bacteria, fungi, blood components)
to the surface of medical devices by immobilizing a thin layer of highly inert and biocompatible perfluorinated
liquid. In preliminary work, we optimized our TLP coating technology for HDC by incorporating a thin
fluoropolymer layer on the catheter surface. We also demonstrated that the optimized coating could reduce
colonization by CRBSI pathogens by rt85% vs. uncoated polyurethane catheter while also effectively reducing
fibrinogen adhesion and thrombosis on the catheter surface.
The objective of this Direct to Phase II SBIR application is to complete our path toward marketability with our
TLP-modified HDC (TLP HDC). Using a previously established domestic sheep model, we will test the central
hypothesis that TLP HDC will out-perform standard HDC by decreasing fibrin sheath formation, which has a
close relationship with both catheter dysfunction and biofilm formation. This will be achieved using three aims.
Aim 1: Compare the in vivo effectiveness of TLP HDC and standard HDC (Palindrome®) at reducing fibrin
sheath formation and catheter tip occlusion. Aim 2: Obtain GMP-manufactured TLP HDC. Aim 3: Initiate the
510(k) application process to obtain FDA premarketing approval and perform a biocompatibility study. These
advances will allow FFMD to maximize the effectiveness of the TLP coating and dramatically improve HD
patient care by reducing catheter dysfunction and the CRBSI rate in clinical settings."

victims of a radiological accident or nuclear terrorism, thereby significantly increasing the chance of survival if
such a radiological event were to occur today. However, survivors of acute radiation toxicities may develop
delayed injuries that become clinically apparent months to years after exposure. Cardiovascular disease is one
of the main sources of morbidity and mortality in survivors of acute exposure to ionizing radiation. Nearly ten
percent of Japanese atomic bomb survivors died of cardiovascular disease, and cancer patients undergoing
thoracic radiation therapy (RT) involving cardiac exposures exhibit a 1.7- to 2-fold greater heart disease
mortality. In several reports, patients treated with RT for esophageal cancer exhibited a 1-in-3 chance of
pericardial effusion with median occurrence post-treatment of only 6 months. Since clinical reversal of
radiation-induced cardiovascular disease is difficult, if not impossible once a survivor becomes symptomatic, it
is critical to identify such injuries sooner so that the proper interventions can begin. Therefore, availability of a
blood-based test that would predict risk for delayed radiation injuries such as in the heart in asymptomatic
victims of radiation incidents is an urgent and unmet need. Herein, we propose to extend our SBIR Phase I
work to further develop our multi-omics-based CardioWatch biomarker assay. In our Phase I effort, the
CardioWatch panel predicted radiation-induced heart disease in mouse models of exposure to gamma-rays
(AUC rt90%). Furthermore, biomarkers in this panel were also found to be dysregulated in serum of non-human
primates (NHP) 3-6 days after partial body irradiation. Finally, the panel was verified in a cohort of patients that
developed cardiac complications following RT for esophageal cancer. In the proposed Phase II study, we will
conduct a rigorous analytic validation of the CardioWatch assay, followed by blinded validation in test samples
from rat models as well as longitudinally collected samples from an elite survivor cohort of NHPs (N=56,
sampling at 3 time points) and a cohort of esophageal cancer patients (N=45) undergoing RT with monitoring
for cardiac outcomes. FDA biomarker qualification guidance will be sought at all steps to ensure successful
completion of technical objectives compliant with guidelines for evaluating commercialization potential of
biomarker-based tests. The final product of this study will be a multi-omics biomarker assay replete with
detailed standard operating procedures and a software algorithm (MetaboWatch) with a graphical user
interface provides interpretation of biomarker data and an overall risk score. Cross-validation among a
spectrum of biological samples will establish and solidify performance measurements for the CardioWatch
assay at independent clinical sites for future clinical use. The CardioWatch assay could be used as a stand-
alone risk assessment test or in conjunction with routine clinical screening. Following success in Phase II
studies, we will perform clinical evaluations to support an FDA clearance to market in a Phase IIB effort."

Many facilities currently use photocathode materials with excitation by high power ultraviolet pulses, which places extreme demands on system components. Therefore, photocathode materials operating in the visible spectrum are being developed. One impediment to a systematic characterization of these materials is the lack of a suitable high-power excitation laser that is tunable across a wide range with high performance. We propose a laser-driven optical parametric amplification system, which will provide tunable 10’s of picosecond pulses in the visible spectrum at high energy and high repetition rate. Our system emphasizes efficiency in the tunable laser system design to scale to high average power. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed technique for the generation of tunable visible pulses for photocathode characterization. We built a prototype novel nonlinear fiber- amplifier seed source and constructed an optical parametric amplifier followed by conversion to tunable visible pulses, at 200kHz repetition rate. Experiments were guided by a numerical model. In Phase II, we will scale our tunable laser system to high average power. We will build a fiber amplifier and parametric amplifier operating at 1 MHz repetition rate, ultimately outputting tunable microjoule pulses of tens of picoseconds duration. Extended numerical models will guide and optimize system performance. Our proposed instrument will provide a valuable tool that can ultimately enable next generation electron accelerator user facilities to operate on a smaller footprint, be built at lower cost, and enhance availability, therefore increasing applications in the medical, research, and security sectors. Our proposed instrument also serves the ultrafast laser market by providing both tunable picosecond pulses, and amplified femtosecond pulses in spectral regions that lack broad gain bandwidths in standard laser materials."

Conventional surface NMR has been proven as a powerful non-invasive technique for coarse groundwater imaging. The method is limited, however, by simplistic imaging protocols. To enhance sensitivity and spatial resolution, we will introduce “switched-field” NMR.This new paradigm combines gradient and prepolarization fields to allow localization of signals based on their frequency and phase response and will increase the signal-to-noise ratio for shallow water.

Integrated Sensors, LLC has demonstrated two new types of high-performance scintillator materials as key components in a novel beam monitoring system designed to provide major advantages over current technology. The patented beam monitoring system has been designed to take advantage of both materials and can provide continuous real-time high-speed readout of beam position, shape, intensity, with high spatial resolution and single-particle sensitivity/position capability. The Phase-II program succeeded in demonstrating exceptional particle sensitivity/performance in terms of operation and imaging over an extremely wide intensity range from single-particles imaging to approximately 1011 particles per second. This level of performance and beam imaging inside a particle beamline greatly exceeded the programs initial goals/objectives and was demonstrated in real-time with ultra-high spatial resolution at the DOE Facility for Rare Isotope Beams located at Michigan State University. The new materials also demonstrated exceptional radiation damage resistance and can be made ultrathin and essentially transparent to the fast particle beams. The Integrated Sensors beam monitoring system offers a breath of capability not available in any other beam monitor system and could achieve an unprecedent payback time of just several months per unit due to the very significant savings in beam tuning time. The Phase-IIB program is planned for just one-year and will transition from R&amp;D to development of a flexible modular product platform that can be easily customized for different applications in a wide variety of particle beam environments. The system will also be very cost competitive and will also be able to self-calibrate with minimal maintenance required. The commercial applications for the proposed technology are scientific, industrial and medical. The scientific applications are primarily directed at nuclear physics, but can also be important for high energy physics, etc. For industrial applications there are more than ten thousand small accelerators and many could benefit by the proposed technology. However, the greatest benefit could be in the medical field for the treatment of cancer by external beam radiation therapy, including the newest treatment being explored of FLASH radiotherapy. The proposed technology should improve the efficacy of cancer treatment and while advancing nuclear physics research by providing better and faster beam monitoring, better beam control and even reduced cost."

The specific focus is on prior authorization processing, where payers and prescribers must reach a consensus on medical necessity. The project delivers a solution to optimize prescription authorization and provide more comprehensive patient histories for clinical authorization criteria fulfillment than other available products on the current health technology market. Lack of efficient access to reliable patient histories is the principal reason for delayed authorizations, resulting in delayed care access. A 2022 survey showed 93% of physicians reported that prior authorization often or always creates care delays; 82% reported delays that led to treatment abandonment. A secure yet progressively decentralized patient data transfer protocol would heighten transparency of clinical decision-making processes and also increase opportunities for patient engagement during prior authorization of medical prescriptions. Further, since administrative costs increase the cost of benefits, which in turn increases the cost of care access, the potential commercial impact is that payers who lower administrative costs will be better positioned to offer higher reimbursement rates for a greater range of quality treatment options, at increasingly lower cost._x000D_
_x000D_
This SBIR Phase II project proposes to deliver a distributed ledger with smart contracts specific to the domain of pharmaceutical benefits. Since the cause of processing inefficiency lies with siloed and incomplete patient histories, this protocol resolves administrative inefficiencies through distributed ledger technology supporting fast and compliant encrypted health data sharing among prescribers, payers, and patients. Research objectives include: 1) automating criteria fulfillment to reduce administrative waste; 2) leveraging machine learning to automate simpler case reviews; and 3) designing a shared interorganizational processing protocol capable of adapting to an introduction of revised clinical standards. Smart contracts will be deployed to a distributed ledger infrastructure to formalize and enforce clinical standards as well as contractually specified financial rules and actuarial analyses at an interorganizational level. With smart contracts embedded in the authorization process to automatically curate more robust clinical histories over each prescription lifecycle, available real world data meeting contractually specified quality standards for clinical review will increase. Historical authorization data will feed back into incrementally complex cases, advancing artificial intelligence for authorization decision support. The expected result is improved real-time insight into clinical risk, affording payers the ability to financially and strategically adapt to patient needs with increasing precision and agility._x000D_

Advances in molecular biology and genetic engineering have led to the design and use of modified T cells
recognize tumors to achieve significant tumor control upon adoptive cell transfer (ACT) to patients. These T cells
are either transduced with tumor antigen reactive T cell receptors (TCR), or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs).
Recently, a surge in studies with neo-antigen reactive T cells or T cells recognizing novel mutated antigens has
also shown promise. While the implementation of these studies requires significant technical resources, the
appearance of antigen loss variants also leads to less effective tumor control when using effector T cells reactive
to single tumor antigen or target molecule. Thus, there is a resurgence in using tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs), which have endogenous T cells reactive to multiple tumor epitopes, for ACT. While most studies have
used the conventional approach to expand TILs using high dose IL2, some recent studies using IL15 or IL21
showed improved tumor control. Preclinical studies have also shown that different subsets of both helper CD4+
T helper (Th) cells and CD8+ T cytotoxic (Tc) cells hold promise for clinical use in ACT protocols. Importantly, T
helper cell subsets with the ability to secrete IL-17 (Th17) have been shown to possess stem cell like phenotype
that attributes to their long-term persistence and leads to improved tumor control tumors as compared to the Th1
subsets (that secrete IFNγ, IL2, TNFα). However, contrary to these observations there are reports that Tc1 cells
exhibit improved tumor control as compared to Tc17 cells. These differences in T cell subsets response to control
tumors, is compounded by the fact that in the suppressive tumor microenvironment a large fraction of these Th
or Tc subsets acquire FoxP3+ regulatory phenotype, become dysfunctional or undergo cell death leading to
tumor reversion. Thus, ex vivo programming conditions that can render a stable phenotype with reduced
‘plasticity’ and not only controls primary tumors, but also results in formation of anti-tumor memory will be of
immense importance in ACT. We have recently established that programming conditions that bring together
‘anti-tumor effector function’ of Th1 cells and ‘stemness’ of Th17 cells lead to a superior hybrid Th1/17 (and
Tc/17) cell exhibiting long-term tumor control. Thus, in the Phase I application we successfully tested the
feasibility of programming metabolically enhanced signature to TILs from melanoma and prostate cancer
patients. For the Phase II application, we hypothesize that ex vivo programming and expansion using hybrid
T1/17 (Th1/17 and Tc1/17) culture conditions will result in a robust anti-tumor control even with fewer adoptively
transferred clinical grade metabolically enhanced TILs (meTILs). Following specific aims are proposed to
establish and develop our approach for commercialization: Specific Aim 1: To generate clinical-grade hybrid
meTILs from melanoma and prostate cancer patients. Specific Aim 2: To establish if clinical grade hybrid meTILs
are superior to conventional TILs in controlling tumor growth in vivo. We believe that this proposal will help adopt
the novel ex vivo programming conditions for generating hybrid meTILs that could be used future in adoptive T-
cell immunotherapy clinical trials."

Recent animal studies have demonstrated that the earliest cochlear pathology due to noise and aging involves a loss of the inner hair cell ribbon synapse. The early consequences of this synaptic loss are not believed to affect hearing sensitivity, but rather, impair speech understanding in background noise. While this condition, called cochlear synaptopathy or hidden hearing loss, can be detected in animal models by a reduction of suprathreshold sound evoked wave-1 amplitude of auditory brainstem response (ABR) and confirmed by post-mortem quantitative histology, its diagnosis in humans remains challenging. Several non-invasive electrophysiological methods such as ABR and electrocochleography (ECochG) have been tested to detect human cochlear synaptopathy. Two major obstacles to their proposed application include: (1) a high variability of ABR/ECochG wave amplitudes, and (2) a lack of direct histological validation for living humans. My strategy here is to develop a new electrical device able to generate a calibration pulse to reduce high variability in ABR/ECochG wave metrics. The validation issue will be addressed by applying machine learning to identify multiple ABR/ECochG markers associated with cochlear synaptopathy first in animal models, in which cochlear synaptopathy can be directly validated by histologic synaptic counting, and then apply these identified features for human diagnosis. My hypothesis is that clinical diagnosis of human cochlear synaptopathy can be achieved by improving both hardware and software related to ABR/ECochG data collection and analysis. Based on our preliminary studies, we will continue to improve our electrical circuit to test if our calibration pulse device can address the variability issue, and at the same time, we will identify ABR/ECochG features associated with age-related cochlear synaptopathy in mice and then validate these identified features in gerbils since its hearing range is similar to humans. Finally, I will perform a longitudinal study to test identified features in humans during aging.Early detection of cochlear synaptopathy may lead to effective preventive strategies that would delay or potentially prevent further development of ARHL. Completion of this project is therefore expected to lead to a major shift in current clinical diagnosis of ARHL, while providing a unique training opportunity for the principal investigator to develop skills in developing commercial medical devices."

This project addresses the market need for the non-invasive, real-time, field-based hydration assessment of athletes. Acute water loss (dehydration) during sports participation induced by long-term exposure to hot and humid conditions leads to adverse health conditions. Dehydration impacts an athlete’s health in four critical areas: cardiovascular stress, cognitive impairment, thermoregulation failure, and heat stroke. Limitations of current field-based methods include the use of manual (e.g., weight charts) or invasive assessments (e.g., urine tests). The company's fully integrated wearable sensor performs bioimpedance spectroscopy for non-invasive, real-time hydration monitoring. Continuous measurements generate a bioimpedance profile unique to each athlete that captures the fluctuations from the extracellular water and intracellular water compartments. Thisinnovation will give athletic trainers insight into their athletes’ safety, health, and performance. Phase II objectives include: 1) building the cloud-based platform, 2) advancing the functionality and sensitivity of the wearable sensor, and 3) deploying the proprietary deep learning algorithms to the cloud for large-scale monitoring.

Varicocele is the most common cause of male infertility and is also associated with testicular pain, erectile disfunction, and low free testosterone. Varicocele affects approximately 30 million men in the US alone and is the direct cause of over 1.5 million infertile couples. Current methods of treatment have low success rates, with only 50% of patients noticing greater than 50% improvement in sperm parameters and up to 37% of patients showing no change after treatment. The treatment for varicocele has not changed since 1929 and consists of ligation or occlusion of the internal spermatic vein, the primary route of drainage for the testis. Even though surgical ligation procedures have shown promising clinical efficacy, the technical difficulty in performing the procedures and low success rates leave room for improvement. _x000D_
_x000D_
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to leverage a highly effective procedure proposed to treat varicocele. This procedure was proposed in the 1980s and was based on an advanced understanding of hemodynamics responsible for pathophysiology of varicocele. Through initial studies, this procedure showed groundbreaking results and has been used in multiple independent studies to treat patients with close to 100% success rates. Additionally, the complication rates are significantly lower, with complete elimination of hydrocele formation, recurrence rates of less than 0.2% and faster recovery times. However, this procedure has not caught widespread adoption due to the high skill required to perform this procedure. This SBIR project seeks to develop a technology that will lower the barrier to perform the highly challenging procedure, thereby making the procedure a reality for patients of varicocele and infertility. The resulting device may afford patients the benefits of surgery, without the risk, ultimately reducing overall cost of care associated with patients of infertility._x000D_

The proposed technology has the potential to improve the diagnosis and safety of contrast-enhanced MRA. This creates a win-win-win scenario for everyone involved. For patients with vascular disease, this solution provides a safer alternative with a more accurate diagnosis that will allow doctors to prescribe safer, more effective treatments. For the patient’s family, it reduces financial and social burdens by enabling preventive treatment due to earlier disease detection. For radiologists, the clearer MRA images may lead to more accurate diagnoses. The product will be marketed to radiologists and medical institutions that perform MRA to diagnose vascular thrombosis, renal stenosis, and pediatric MRA._x000D_

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to optimize an iron-based BPCA for use in MRA for the detection of vascular diseases. Contrast-enhanced MRA is a staple diagnostic procedure for imaging blood vessels.The market is currently dominated by gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) due to their excellent contrast enhancing effects; however, due to their potential toxicity, GBCAs are designed to be rapidly cleared, leaving only a short window for MRA image acquisition and resulting in suboptimal image quality of blood vessels. To address the need for a safer contrast agent able to provide enhanced vascular imaging, the Phase II project will optimize an iron-based contrast agent that will enable an extended imaging window for improved MRA resolution, but which is removed by kidney filtration. The research objectives include: (1) optimizing the minimum viable product to enable dose reduction and enhance the safety profile; (2) evaluating diagnostic imaging efficacy and toxicology; and (3) demonstrating a scale-up manufacturing process for the synthesis of the final formulation. This solution addresses the major points required to de-risk commercialization and bring the technology closer to the market._x000D_

This project aims to develop the 2P-ActivityScope™, a revolutionary new microscope based on a technological
breakthrough called second-generation Scanned Line Angular Projection (SLAP2) two photon laser scanning
microscopy that was recently developed by Dr. Kaspar Podgorski (Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes
Medical Institute, Ashburn, VA). The game-changing innovation in the 2P-ActivityScope is the ability to perform
unparalleled (i) optical imaging of neuronal activity in populations of neurons at subcellular spatial resolution and
temporal resolution in the millisecond range both in vivo and in vitro using a variety of fluorescent indicators (e.g.
voltage, [neurotransmitter]) as well as (ii) high-resolution volumetric calcium imaging of columns of cortical
neurons at 40 Hz in vivo. These capabilities are crucial for ultimately decoding how information is represented
and processed by the billions of densely interconnected neurons comprising the mammalian central nervous
system. Neither contemporary 2-photon microscopes, functional magnetic resonance imaging, inserting
electrodes into the brain, or fiber photometry can serve this need. This project will disseminate and improve upon
the original, lab-built SLAP2 invention to create a commercial product for this important new technology. Based
on pilot work performed at Janelia, it is clear that the 2P-ActivityScope will make a significant impact on the field
of neuroscience research, including advancing studies focused on alterations in CNS circuitry associated with
neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Ultimately, this will result in an
improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of complex brain diseases. In
Phase I we will demonstrate feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype hardware and software;
work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of the 2P-ActivityScope for commercial release. We
will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of the 2P-ActivityScope in close
collaboration with Dr. Podgorski and our academic collaboration partners. A competing technology is not
commercially available."

Stroke affects more than 795,000 patients per year in the US and kills approximately 40,000. Long-term medical
care expense for stroke in the US, costs over $34B per year. Large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke accounts for
almost 40% of ischemic strokes but causes 95% of mortality and 62% of long-term dependence. Mechanical
thrombectomy (MT), or a combination of MT and tPA, has emerged as standard of care treatment of LVO stroke.
Up to 60% of thrombectomy patients are first evaluated at spoke hospitals and transferred to hub hospitals for
MT. `Time is brain' following stroke, the sooner therapy can be instituted, the greater the likelihood of preserving
neurological function. A therapy that could be rapidly deployed in all stroke patients to preserve the brain could
provide enormous potential benefit to stroke patients.
NanO2TM (aka dodecafluoropentane emulsion, DDFPe) significantly decreased stroke volume (SV), by about
85%, and improved neurological assessment score (NAS) in rabbits when administered IV up to 3 hours following
stroke and also improved SV and NAS in permanent rat MCAo. In a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase Ib/II
clinical trial of acute ischemic stroke, in which patients receive standard reperfusion therapy, NanO2 was safe at
all dose levels. The higher doses of NanO2 caused significantly better modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 30 and
90-days post stroke. Early administration of NanO2 (lt5 hours from onset) presented with significantly better NIH
Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores. NanO2 is active at very low doses (e.g. 0.1 to 0.17 mL of 2% w/vol emulsion per
kg body weight) and clears via exhalation with a terminal half-life of about 90 minutes in humans. NanO2 was
previously tested as an ultrasound contrast agent in 2,230 patients and was considered safe and approvable by
the FDA and EMEA. The Specific Aims are 1) to manufacture DDFPe GMP for SPAN studies and to scale-up
GMP manufacturing, 2) to test drug in tMCAo models in lean, adult and aged Wistar rats and 3) to perform
studies in obese, diabetic Zucker rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats.
Expected Outcome: NanO2 will show great efficacy in rodent tMCAo models enabling this drug to be considered
as a candidate for entry into clinical trials in ischemic stroke sponsored by StrokeNet."

such threats as radiological dispersal devices (i.e., “dirty bomb”) and nuclear accidents, which may be caused
by extreme weather (such as occurred in Fukushima, Japan in 2011). Radiation exposure can be potentially
lethal via the hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) and the gastrointestinal-ARS (GI-ARS). The
U.S. government has committed to supporting development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) to mitigate
morbidity and mortality of these radiation syndromes. Re-purposed leukemia drugs have proven useful in
treatment of the H-ARS in preclinical models, but there remains no effective MCM for GI-ARS.
Ceramedix, Inc. is developing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates with the goal of preventing and
mitigating illness due to radiation exposure. Our lead candidate, CX-01, is an anti-ceramide single-chain
variable antibody fragment (scFv) that binds ceramide on the exocellular leaflet of the plasma membrane of
radiation-injured endothelial cells in the GI tract and in other organs. By binding ceramide, ceramide-rich
platforms are disrupted, thereby preventing cellular death. Extensive data in multiple species, including non-
human primates (NHPs), show that disrupting the ceramide signaling pathway protects and mitigates the GI-
ARS. We have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in NHPs as well as mortality benefits in mice. CX-01
may be administered subcutaneously, a critical advantage during mass casualty events.
Ceramedix’ therapeutics may have broad application in multiple additional diseases. Ceramide-rich
platform signaling is a ubiquitous damage response pathway that drives cell injury and death in response to
diverse disease and environmental stimuli. Ceramedix has generated significant preclinical data supporting
treatment of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Ceramedix is also exploring other diseases
including diabetic nephropathy and pulmonary injury (fibrosis and other pulmonary syndromes).
The overall goal of this work is to validate that CX-01 demonstrates equivalent potency and efficacy as a
precursor non-humanized scFv molecule. We will perform in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies to
support CX-01 IND acceptance.
The ability to prevent and treat GI-ARS would have profound benefits in protecting civilians and defense
personnel. There is no current treatment for GI-ARS, particularly one suitable for field administration following
a mass casualty event. USG has prioritized this critical unmet medical need.
CX-01 represents a major breakthrough in potential treatment of the lethal GI-ARS. CX-01 has the
potential to become the first and only available treatment for GI-ARS. Successful completion of this work will
accelerate IND submission and clinical evaluation of Ceramedix’ transformative therapeutic platform."
